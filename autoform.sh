# separate "scan every .sc file for `using` directives" classpath step) fall
# back to the PLATFORM DEFAULT charset when none is set -- which is plain
# ASCII/POSIX on a bare container with no locale configured, Colab's own
# default runtime included. Reading any non-ASCII byte under that charset
# throws mid-file, corrupting the compiler's own view of everything after it
# and surfacing as a cascade of unrelated "Not found" errors from that point
# to the end of the file -- not a hint that anything in the source itself is
# wrong. Confirmed live: identical failure, same two line numbers, across
# four completely unrelated fixtures, on a Colab runtime that reproduced it
# after this session's own local sandbox (once it hit the identical failure
# earlier) could not, purely because the sandbox's own commands had been
# carrying `LANG=C.UTF-8` explicitly ever since -- a workaround on the
# CALLER's side, never fixed here, where every actual invocation needs it.

# `009-reduce-remaining-holes-4`: `cartographer/run.sh`'s own `CPP_DEFINES`
# mechanism, ported here so `autoform.sh` (the pipeline this whole feature's
# own local sandbox testing runs, and what `notebooks/*.ipynb`'s
# `run_one_background` calls for the FULL corpus) has the SAME capability
# `run_one_chunked_background`'s own separate, inline joern-parse call
# already had -- this script had simply never been given it. For a C/C++
# tree, set CPP_DEFINES to a comma-separated list of names Joern's C frontend
# (which does not run the real preprocessor) should treat as defined --
# either bare (`SQLITE_TEST`, an `#ifdef`-guarded feature flag: without it,
# guarded code parses with its raw `.code` kept but ZERO ast children,
# reported honestly as `stmt:empty-ast-children`) or `NAME=VALUE` (a plain
# macro TOKEN substitution: `ALIGN128=`, `SQLITE_API=`, `SQLITE_EXTERN=extern`
# -- SQLite's own attribute/linkage macros, which the frontend cannot resolve
# at all without preprocessing and gives up on entirely, reported as
# `stmt:UNKNOWN:CASTProblemDeclaration`; a DIFFERENT failure mode from the
# `#ifdef` case, needing a value substitution rather than a bare presence
# flag). Empty by default: no behavior change for a codebase this does not
# apply to, or when the caller does not set it.
