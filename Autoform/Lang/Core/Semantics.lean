# Core — semantics

A fuel-indexed definitional interpreter for the universal core language. This is the
formal interpreter that an arbitrary codebase is mapped onto.

Design commitments, each of which exists to keep the trust story honest:

* **Total.** Structurally recursive on fuel, so evaluation always terminates and Lean
  accepts it without `partial`. No `sorry`, no `unsafe`.
* **Holes are observable.** Reaching a hole yields a distinguished outcome — not an
  error, not a value. A theorem about a program can therefore never accidentally
  quantify over behaviour we failed to translate.
* **Ignorance is distinguishable from behaviour.** `outOfFuel` (we did not run long
  enough), `hole` (we did not translate this), a raised exception, and a genuine result
  are four different outcomes, because they mean four different things.
* **The heap is explicit.** Objects are boxed and mutable; the heap is threaded through
  evaluation rather than hidden in a monad, so the recursion stays visibly structural.

## Dialect-sensitive arithmetic

Integer division and modulo are **not** universal: Python floors, C and Java truncate
toward zero. Hardcoding one convention silently mistranslates every other language, so
the dialect is carried explicitly and recorded by the transpiler.

This was not designed in. It was found by `scripts/differential.py`, which caught
`fmod(6, -9)` returning `6` in Lean against CPython's `-3`, and the same error
propagating into `gcdish`. That is what the conformance oracle is for.

`ub` becomes a **hole**, not a number. A program that relies on undefined behaviour has

/-! ### Floating point

`Autoform/Lang/Core/Float.lean` supplies the value domain and the arithmetic; this section
is only the wiring. Three decisions are recorded here because they are the ones that can
be silently wrong.

**Promotion.** In mixed `int`/`float` *arithmetic* both Python and C convert the integer
to a double and compute in binary64, so `flOfVal` promotes. Python raises `OverflowError`
if the integer is too large to convert (reachable only under `.python`, since `.cLike`
integers are 32-bit and always convertible), and `FConfig.ofInt` reproduces that.

**Comparison does *not* promote — under Python.** CPython compares an `int` and a `float`
*exactly*: `10**23 == 1e23` is `False`, because `1e23` is really
`99999999999999991611392`. C has no bignums and its `==` promotes, so the two dialects
genuinely differ here and `flCmp` splits on the dialect. Promoting under `.python` would
be a silent wrong answer of the `floorDiv` family.

**`/` on two integers is still floor division, and that is now a known wrong answer for
Python.** CPython's `/` is *true* division (`7 / 2 == 3.5`) and `//` floors. The
transpiler currently maps Python's `//` onto the `"/"` operator string (see the note above
`applyBinop_py_div` and `Refine.lean`'s discussion of `op:floorDiv`), so `"/"` on two
`.int`s is left exactly as it was — changing it would silently break every `//` in the
corpora. `"//"` is now a distinct operator with the floor semantics, so the fix is in
`cartographer/render_lean.py`: emit `"//"` for floor division and `"/"` for true division,
after which `"/"` on two `.int`s under `.python` must become `flBinop`. Until then this is
a recorded silent mistranslation, not an accident.

**NaN is unordered.** `flCmp` returns `none`, and `ordToE` turns that into `false` for
`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` and `==`, and `true` for `!=`. That is CPython's behaviour and it is
not expressible by an `Ordering` alone. -/

/-- Lift a float outcome into an evaluation outcome. `ub` and `unmodelled` both become
holes — the first because the language does not define the result, the second because we
have not modelled it — and they keep distinct labels so the ledger can tell them apart. -/

### Operator equations

Refinement proofs need `applyBinop` to reduce cleanly. For the unbounded (Python) config
these are definitional; for fixed-width configs they are *conditional on
representability*, which is the whole point — a C function only agrees with its
mathematical model where nothing overflows.

/-! ## The calling convention

`f(*xs, k=v, **d)` and `def f(a, *args, **kwargs)` are one mechanism, split across two
places: `evalList` turns an argument list into a **positional list plus a keyword list**,
and `bindParams` turns those two lists plus a `Func`'s parameter description into an
environment.

Both halves are ordinary total functions — `bindParams` is not even recursive on fuel —
so the interpreter's seven-way mutual recursion is unchanged in shape and
`Autoform/FuelMono.lean` still covers exactly the same functions. -/

/-- View a value as keyword bindings, for `**e`. Only a `dict` whose keys are *all*
strings qualifies: CPython raises `TypeError: keywords must be strings` otherwise, and
`argument after ** must be a mapping` for a non-`dict`, so `none` here means "raise",
never "ignore". -/
def strKeyed : Val → Option (List (String × Val))
  | .dict kvs =>
      kvs.foldr (fun kv acc =>
        match kv.1, acc with
        | .str k, some rest => some ((k, kv.2) :: rest)
        | _,      _         => none) (some [])

/-- The parameters that receive positional arguments: every parameter except the
variadic ones. -/
def Func.posParams (fn : Func) : List String :=
  fn.params.filter fun p => fn.vararg != some p && fn.kwarg != some p

/-- Bind a call's arguments into the callee's environment.

The rule is CPython's, minus default values (which Core does not model):

* positional arguments fill `posParams` left to right;
* leftovers go to `vararg` as a `tuple` — an empty one when there are none, which is
  why `def f(*a)` called with no arguments binds `a` to `()` rather than to `unit`;
* a keyword argument naming a positional parameter binds that parameter;
* every other keyword argument goes to `kwarg` as a `dict` with `str` keys.

Two deliberate departures, both recorded rather than hidden:

* **Surplus positional arguments are dropped when there is no `*args`.** CPython raises
  `TypeError`. This is the behaviour `applyFunc` already had (`params.zip vs` truncates),
  and it is left alone here so that this change is about starred arguments only.
* **A keyword argument matching no parameter is dropped here** when there is no
  `**kwargs`. `bindParams` is only the binding half; `kwargsRejected` below detects that
  case and `applyFunc` turns it into CPython's `TypeError` before the body ever runs, so
  the drop is never observable. Nothing previously produced keyword arguments, so this
  cannot change any existing behaviour. -/

Deliberately **refuses** two shapes rather than approximating them:

* a class that defines its own `__init__` — Core would have to run it against a value
  that has no mutable attributes, so whatever it did would be lost;
* a class that defines its own `__eq__` — `Val.beq` compares `bobj`s by contents and

/-- Run module initializers into a shared globals frame, then call an entry point.

Module-level bindings are mutable and outlive any single call, so they live in a heap
object rather than in `Env`. The transpiler emits one zero-argument `Func` per source
module (`moduleInits`); running them in order is what makes module constants, classes and
functions resolvable.

Initializer order is the caller's responsibility: the transpiler cannot recover a
cross-file dependency order from the CPG, so a module that reads another module's globals
must be listed after it. That is a real limitation, not a detail — it is recorded as an
open item rather than papered over with a guessed ordering. -/

/-! ## C and C++ pointers, end to end

The exporter now maps `p->f` to `Expr.field`, `p[i]` to `Expr.index`, C++ stack
construction to `Expr.alloc`, and `&x` on an aggregate to `x` itself. Each of those is a
*mapping* decision, and a mapping decision is exactly the kind that can be wrong while
every downstream theorem still passes: an `Expr.field` that resolved to nothing would
return `unit`, a program full of them would type-check, and the ledger would count it as
translated. So the mappings are checked here by running them.

`boxProg` is what the exporter emits for

    struct Box { int v; Box(int x) { this->v = x; } };
    static int bump(Box *p) { p->v = p->v + 1; return p->v; }
    int run() { Box b(41); return bump(&b); }

with every one of the new decisions visible in the term: the constructor is named
`__init__` (so `Expr.alloc` runs it), its body writes through `self` (not `this`),
`bump` reads and writes `p->v` as `Expr.field` / `Stmt.setField`, and `&b` is just `b`. -/
private def boxProg : Program :=
  { dialect := .cLike
  , funcs :=
    [ { name   := "ns.Box.__init__"
      , params := ["x"]

    , { name   := "ns.run"
      , params := []
      , body   := .seq (.assign "b" (.alloc "Box" [.lit (.int 41)]))
                       (.ret (.call "ns.bump" [.name "b"])) }
      -- `static_cast<uint8_t>(300 + 44)` — a real narrowing, in a real program.
    , { name   := "ns.narrow"
      , params := []
      , body   := .ret (.unop "cast:u8" (.binop "+" (.lit (.int 300)) (.lit (.int 44)))) }
      -- `int a[3] = {7,8,9}; return a[1];` as Core spells an indexable value.
    , { name   := "ns.pick"
      , params := []
      , body   := .ret (.index (.listE [.lit (.int 7), .lit (.int 8), .lit (.int 9)])
                               (.lit (.int 1))) }
      -- The negative control: an object whose field was never written.
    , { name   := "ns.unset"
      , params := []
      , body   := .ret (.field (.alloc "Empty" []) "v") } ] }

/-! The whole chain works: `Box b(41)` allocates and runs the constructor, `&b` is `b`,
`p->v = p->v + 1` mutates *that* object, and the caller sees `42`.

`42` is the load-bearing number. `41` would mean the constructor ran but the write
through the pointer did not reach the same object; `unit` would mean the field read
missed; a hole would mean one of the four mappings is unreachable. Only a correct
pointer round-trip produces `42`.

These are pinned with `#guard_msgs`, not `rfl`: `runFunc` on a heap-allocating program
does not reduce by `whnf` (the `.alloc` case threads a heap through `applyFunc`), so
`rfl` cannot see the answer even though the evaluator computes it immediately.
`#guard_msgs` checks the evaluated result at build time and fails the build if it
changes, which is the property wanted here — and unlike `native_decide` it introduces no
axiom. -/

#guard_msgs in #eval runFunc boxProg 200 "ns.run" []

/-- The cast narrows: `static_cast<uint8_t>(344)` is `88`, matching `cc`. This one does
reduce, so it is stated as a theorem as well. -/

/-- Subscripting reads the element, not the container. -/
example : runFunc boxProg 200 "ns.pick" [] = .val (.int 8) := by rfl

/-! **The known hazard, stated rather than hidden.** `Expr.field` on an object that has
no such field returns `unit`, not a hole — see the `.field` case above. So a C++ class
whose constructor the exporter could not find translates to an object every one of whose
fields reads `unit`, and nothing downstream will say so.

That is why `emit` renames C++ constructors to `__init__` instead of leaving `Expr.alloc`
to allocate an empty object, and why `alloc:builtin-base:*` refuses construction it cannot
model. This check exists so the behaviour is a recorded fact with a test attached, and so
that changing it is a deliberate act rather than an accident. -/

/-! ## Bitwise operators, `for`, and `goto`, checked against `cc`

Every number below was produced by compiling the same fragment with `cc -O0 -fwrapv` on
x86-64 and running it. They are pinned with `#guard_msgs`, which fails the build if the
semantics changes and — unlike `native_decide` — introduces no axiom.

These exist because "the label disappeared from the ledger" is not evidence. An `xor`
that returned `0`, an array initializer that evaluated to `unit`, or a `for` that ran zero
times would each remove a hole and prove nothing; only a checked *value* does. Where a
translation could plausibly have been done a wrong-but-plausible way, the wrong way is
included as a negative control and shown to disagree.

/-- The C constructs the exporter now translates, spelled in Core exactly as it spells
them.

`ns.forSum` is the interesting one. It is the translation of

    int i, s = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) { if (i % 3 == 0) continue; s += i; }
    return s * 100 + i;

under the rule that a `for`'s `continue` must run the **step**: each `continue` in the
body is emitted as `step; continue`. `cc` prints `s=27 i=10`, so the answer is `2710`.

`ns.forNaive` is the same loop under the *textbook* desugaring — `init; while (c) { body;
step }` with the `continue` left alone. It is the negative control, and it does not
terminate: the `continue` jumps back to the test without incrementing `i`. -/
