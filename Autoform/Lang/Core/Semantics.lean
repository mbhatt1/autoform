# Core — semantics

A fuel-indexed definitional interpreter for the universal core language. This is the
formal interpreter that an arbitrary codebase is mapped onto.

Design commitments, each of which exists to keep the trust story honest:

* **Total.** Structurally recursive on fuel, so evaluation always terminates and Lean
  accepts it without `partial`. No `sorry`, no `unsafe`.
* **Holes are observable.** Reaching a hole yields a distinguished outcome — not an
  error, not a value. A theorem about a program can therefore never accidentally
  quantify over behaviour we failed to translate.
* **Ignorance is distinguishable from behaviour.** `outOfFuel` (we did not run long
  enough), `hole` (we did not translate this), a raised exception, and a genuine result
  are four different outcomes, because they mean four different things.
* **The heap is explicit.** Objects are boxed and mutable; the heap is threaded through
  evaluation rather than hidden in a monad, so the recursion stays visibly structural.

## Dialect-sensitive arithmetic

Integer division and modulo are **not** universal: Python floors, C and Java truncate
toward zero. Hardcoding one convention silently mistranslates every other language, so
the dialect is carried explicitly and recorded by the transpiler.

This was not designed in. It was found by `scripts/differential.py`, which caught
`fmod(6, -9)` returning `6` in Lean against CPython's `-3`, and the same error
propagating into `gcdish`. That is what the conformance oracle is for.

`ub` becomes a **hole**, not a number. A program that relies on undefined behaviour has
no defined meaning at that point, so the honest translation is "we cannot say" — the same
discipline applied to untranslated constructs. Returning some plausible number here would
be the same class of error as the original modulo bug, only harder to detect. -/

/-! ### Floating point

`Autoform/Lang/Core/Float.lean` supplies the value domain and the arithmetic; this section
is only the wiring. Three decisions are recorded here because they are the ones that can
be silently wrong.

**Promotion.** In mixed `int`/`float` *arithmetic* both Python and C convert the integer
to a double and compute in binary64, so `flOfVal` promotes. Python raises `OverflowError`
if the integer is too large to convert (reachable only under `.python`, since `.cLike`
integers are 32-bit and always convertible), and `FConfig.ofInt` reproduces that.

**Comparison does *not* promote — under Python.** CPython compares an `int` and a `float`
*exactly*: `10**23 == 1e23` is `False`, because `1e23` is really
`99999999999999991611392`. C has no bignums and its `==` promotes, so the two dialects
genuinely differ here and `flCmp` splits on the dialect. Promoting under `.python` would
be a silent wrong answer of the `floorDiv` family.

**`/` on two integers is still floor division, and that is now a known wrong answer for
Python.** CPython's `/` is *true* division (`7 / 2 == 3.5`) and `//` floors. The
transpiler currently maps Python's `//` onto the `"/"` operator string (see the note above
`applyBinop_py_div` and `Refine.lean`'s discussion of `op:floorDiv`), so `"/"` on two
`.int`s is left exactly as it was — changing it would silently break every `//` in the
corpora. `"//"` is now a distinct operator with the floor semantics, so the fix is in
`cartographer/render_lean.py`: emit `"//"` for floor division and `"/"` for true division,
after which `"/"` on two `.int`s under `.python` must become `flBinop`. Until then this is
a recorded silent mistranslation, not an accident.

**NaN is unordered.** `flCmp` returns `none`, and `ordToE` turns that into `false` for
`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=` and `==`, and `true` for `!=`. That is CPython's behaviour and it is
not expressible by an `Ordering` alone. -/

/-- Lift a float outcome into an evaluation outcome. `ub` and `unmodelled` both become
holes — the first because the language does not define the result, the second because we
have not modelled it — and they keep distinct labels so the ledger can tell them apart. -/

### Operator equations

Refinement proofs need `applyBinop` to reduce cleanly. For the unbounded (Python) config
these are definitional; for fixed-width configs they are *conditional on
representability*, which is the whole point — a C function only agrees with its
mathematical model where nothing overflows.

/-! ## The calling convention

`f(*xs, k=v, **d)` and `def f(a, *args, **kwargs)` are one mechanism, split across two
places: `evalList` turns an argument list into a **positional list plus a keyword list**,
and `bindParams` turns those two lists plus a `Func`'s parameter description into an
environment.

Both halves are ordinary total functions — `bindParams` is not even recursive on fuel —
so the interpreter's seven-way mutual recursion is unchanged in shape and
`Autoform/FuelMono.lean` still covers exactly the same functions. -/

/-- View a value as keyword bindings, for `**e`. Only a `dict` whose keys are *all*
strings qualifies: CPython raises `TypeError: keywords must be strings` otherwise, and
`argument after ** must be a mapping` for a non-`dict`, so `none` here means "raise",
never "ignore". -/

/-- The parameters that receive positional arguments: every parameter except the
variadic ones. -/
def Func.posParams (fn : Func) : List String :=
  fn.params.filter fun p => fn.vararg != some p && fn.kwarg != some p

/-- Bind a call's arguments into the callee's environment.

The rule is CPython's, minus default values (which Core does not model):

* positional arguments fill `posParams` left to right;
* leftovers go to `vararg` as a `tuple` — an empty one when there are none, which is
  why `def f(*a)` called with no arguments binds `a` to `()` rather than to `unit`;
* a keyword argument naming a positional parameter binds that parameter;
* every other keyword argument goes to `kwarg` as a `dict` with `str` keys.

Two deliberate departures, both recorded rather than hidden:

* **Surplus positional arguments are dropped when there is no `*args`.** CPython raises
  `TypeError`. This is the behaviour `applyFunc` already had (`params.zip vs` truncates),
  and it is left alone here so that this change is about starred arguments only.
* **A keyword argument matching no parameter is dropped here** when there is no
  `**kwargs`. `bindParams` is only the binding half; `kwargsRejected` below detects that
  case and `applyFunc` turns it into CPython's `TypeError` before the body ever runs, so
  the drop is never observable. Nothing previously produced keyword arguments, so this
  cannot change any existing behaviour. -/

Deliberately unchanged: it starts from the empty heap, so `Heap.get ctx.globals` finds
nothing and a free name falls through to the function table. This is the right entry point
for a self-contained function, and keeping it stable keeps the refinement layer's
theorems meaningful. Use `runMain` when module-level bindings matter. -/

Exposed separately from `runMain` so that a harness which builds its own heap (e.g. the

`heap.length` onward. -/

/-- Run module initializers into a shared globals frame, then call an entry point.

Module-level bindings are mutable and outlive any single call, so they live in a heap
object rather than in `Env`. The transpiler emits one zero-argument `Func` per source
module (`moduleInits`); running them in order is what makes module constants, classes and
functions resolvable.

Initializer order is the caller's responsibility: the transpiler cannot recover a
cross-file dependency order from the CPG, so a module that reads another module's globals
must be listed after it. That is a real limitation, not a detail — it is recorded as an
open item rather than papered over with a guessed ordering. -/
