# Core — a universal deep-embedded imperative language

`Imp` proved the harness works. `Core` is the real target: it is deliberately shaped to
match **Joern's code property graph node vocabulary**, which already normalizes
C/C++/Java/JavaScript/Python/Kotlin/binaries into a single AST schema.

That is the trick for "arbitrary codebase". We do not write one transpiler per language;
we write one semantics for the CPG core and one CPG→Lean exporter, and every
Joern-supported front end comes along for free.

The price is honesty about coverage, which is why holes are first class:

* `Expr.hole` — an unmapped expression, tagged with the CPG node label that produced it.
* `Stmt.hole` — an unmapped statement, likewise.

Nothing is ever silently dropped. The ledger counts holes, and a program with holes
cannot be proved to do anything at the hole. That is the point, not a limitation.

/-- Source-language dialect.

**Two constructors were not enough** and this was known (STRATEGY.md §29): six languages
have been run through the pipeline and they disagree on integer width, string semantics,
boolean-operator semantics, and equality. `cLike` used to mean "32-bit truncating C" and
was applied to Java, Go, JavaScript and TypeScript, which are none of those things.
`javascript` is the first constructor added past the original two — for JS/TS
specifically, not for Java/Go, which really do agree with `cLike` on `&&`/`||`
(`Lang.dialect` still routes them there).

**What `javascript` fixes, because it was measured wrong (`docs/languages.md`):**
`&&`/`||` now yield an **operand**, not a coerced boolean (`0 || 5` is `5`, not `true`) —
`boolOpsAreValues := true`, like Python. Arithmetic now uses unbounded integers instead
of 32-bit two's-complement wraparound — `toNumConfig .javascript = NumConfig.python` —
which is the specific fix for the measured bug `2147483647 + 1`: Node reports
`2147483648`, the old `.cLike`-routed Core reported `-2147483648` (wrapped), and unbounded
arithmetic now agrees with Node up to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53 - 1).

**What `javascript` does NOT fix, named rather than hidden:** real JS numbers are IEEE
doubles, and this project's `Val` has no single "JS number" representation that is
sometimes-int-sometimes-float the way `Number` is. `NumConfig.python`'s *unbounded*
integers are a known-wrong approximation past 2^53 (`Numeric.lean` recorded this before
this dialect existed), so integer arithmetic beyond `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` is not what
Node computes. `Lang.approximated` marks JavaScript/TypeScript `true` for that reason.

**Since fixed (STRATEGY.md sections 61 and 65):** the bitwise and shift operators are
exact. They used to go through the same unbounded `NumConfig` and so disagreed with JS,
which converts the operands to Int32/Uint32 first (ECMA `ToInt32`/`ToUint32`); `jsBitwise`
and `jsBitNot` (`Semantics.lean`) now do that, and an operand beyond 2^53 is a hole rather
than a guess. `==` and `===` are distinct operators, integer `/` and `%` follow JS
(`jsIntDiv`, `jsIntMod`), and `null` is `Val.jsnull`, distinct from `undefined`
(`Val.unit`). `tests/test_jsnode_node.py` compares 55 such cases with Node. -/

A C aggregate initializer — `static struct crypto_alg alg = { .cra_name = "842", .

`Val.dict` with string keys, and C struct assignment copies, so value semantics is the
right semantics for it. Under a C-family dialect `alg.cra_priority` therefore reads the
key `"cra_priority"` out of that map.

Under Python it must **not**: `{'a': 1}.a` is an `AttributeError`, not `1`, and answering
`1` would be a silent wrong answer of the §12 kind. So `.python` says `false` and the
access stays the `field:a:non-object` hole it has always been.

JavaScript agrees with the C-family answer here, for a different reason: a JS object
literal's fields genuinely are accessible by dot notation (`({a: 1}).a === 1`), so
`.javascript` says `true`, like `.cLike`.

Note what this does *not* buy: a `dict` is not on the heap, so `e.f = v` on one is still
`setField:non-object`. A struct whose fields are written after initialization is a hole,
not a wrong answer. -/

"exact bignum vs. float" comparison to have; `.javascript` says `false`, matching the

  ## Why this shape, and not a payload on `Obj`

  The obvious cheaper alternative is `Obj.builtin : Option Val`, leaving the value a
  `Val.ref`. It does not work, and the reason is structural rather than a matter of
  taste: **`Val.beq`, `applyBinop`, `valIn` and `Val.truthy` do not take the heap.**
  They are pure functions of values, and they are exactly the functions that have to
  agree with the builtin. Making the `Obj` payload visible to them means threading a
  `Heap` through `Val.beq` — which is also the `BEq Val` instance, is used inside
  `Val.beqL`/`beqP`, inside `Stdlib`'s association-list helpers, and inside dozens of
  `Refine.lean` theorems. That is a far larger and more dangerous edit than adding a
  constructor, and it leaves `Val.beq` able to *fail* to consult the heap on any path —
  the silent-wrong failure mode this project keeps finding.

  So the payload lives in the value. There is exactly one copy of an instance's builtin
  state and no way for a value and a heap object to disagree about it.

  ## What this costs, stated plainly

  A `bobj` has **no mutable instance attributes**: it is not on the heap, so `e.f` on one
  is `field:f:non-object` and `e.f = v` is `setField:f:non-object` — holes, not wrong
  answers. `_HashedTuple.__hash__`'s memo field is therefore a hole. Classes with a
  builtin base that define `__init__` or `__eq__` are refused at construction
  (`alloc:builtin-base:...`) rather than silently ignoring them.

  ## What could still silently go wrong

  1. `Val.beq` now compares two `bobj`s, and a `bobj` against a plain builtin, by
     **contents, ignoring the class**. That is CPython's behaviour for `tuple`/`list`/
     `dict`/`str` subclasses that do not override `__eq__` (measured: `A((0,)) ==
     B((0,))` is `True`), and the `__eq__` check at construction is what keeps it true.
     If a future exporter records a builtin base for a class whose `__eq__` it could not
     see, equality would be wrong and nothing here would catch it.
  2. Mutation of a `list`/`dict` base is value-semantics, exactly as Core's own
     containers already are (`setIndex` is `setIndex:immutable-containers`). A `bobj`
     inherits that known unsoundness rather than adding a new one — see
     `docs/boxed-containers.md`.
  3. Any `match` on `Val` with a catch-all that predates this constructor will treat a
     `bobj` as "some other value". Every such site in `Semantics.lean` and `Stdlib.lean`
     was audited; a site added later will not be. -/

  source -- its length is fixed at EXPORT time, which is exactly why a large
  compile-time-sized array (SQLite's own I/O buffers run 512-8,192 elements) blows
  the elaborator's recursion depth or exhausts memory (`research.md` §3, spec 010's
  own Day-1 finding): the SOURCE FILE itself contains one nested list cell per
  element.

  `Expr.boxArray` sidesteps this by construction: it takes a single length
  EXPRESSION, evaluates it ONCE at runtime to a `Val.int`, and the resulting `Obj`'s
  fields (`"0" ↦ .unit, "1" ↦ .unit, ..., "n-1" ↦ .unit`, `List.range` under the
  hood) are built by an ordinary, already-compiled Lean function operating on
  whatever `Nat` the interpreter computes THEN -- no per-element syntax, so no
  elaboration-time cost that scales with the array's size at all, compile-time-known
  or not. This is what makes it usable for `malloc(len)`-shaped C allocations, whose
  size the exporter can never know until the program runs: `zOut = malloc(n);` seeds
  `zOut` as `Val.ref` to a fresh `n`-field `Obj`, `Val.iref` (`Sel.idx`, already
  generic over the position) then walks and reads/writes it exactly like any other
  boxed array -- `irefIndex`/`derefIref`/`setDerefIref`/pointer arithmetic on
  `Val.iref` need no change at all, only a new way to OBTAIN a valid ref to something
  shaped like one. Every field starts `.unit`, matching every other uninitialized
  boxed local/array's own convention -- sound because the only real corpus idiom this
  targets (`malloc` a buffer, walk it with a pointer, write every byte before ever
  reading one back) never observes a field's `.unit` starting value at all. -/
  | boxArray : Expr → Expr

  `Val.iref r (.idx i)`. Takes a full sub-`Expr` for the index (not a literal), since
  most real `&a[i]` sites have a runtime-valued `i`. The address-of counterpart to
  `Expr.index` (a whole-VALUE read); does not replace it. -/

  | irefField : Expr → String → Expr
  /-- `006-reduce-remaining-holes`, Story 5: `*p` where `p` is an interior-pointer
  VALUE (as opposed to `Expr.field`, which takes an explicit field name for a NAMED
  receiver). Requires its operand to evaluate to `Val.iref r sel` and delegates,
  unconditionally, to the unchanged `Heap.getField h r sel.key` -- no `Heap`-level
  change at all. -/
  | derefIref : Expr → Expr
  /-- `009-reduce-remaining-holes-4`: read the byte at position `b` of the string `a`,
  as an integer -- C's `*p`/`p[i]` on a `char*` walked as a byte cursor, which is
  fundamentally NOT `Expr.index`'s existing meaning. `Expr.index` on a `.str` receiver
  has no case in `evalExpr` at all today (confirmed by reading it directly): Python's
  own `s[i]` returns a length-1 `Val.str` (matching CPython), but C's `*p` needs an
  INTEGER byte value comparable via arithmetic (`*z == '"'`, `*z - '0'`) -- the two
  languages want different return types from the identical `a[b]` syntax, so one
  semantics cannot honestly serve both. Giving `Expr.index` a `.str` case that returns
  an integer would silently mistranslate the (currently unsupported, so not yet relied
  on by anything) Python shape; a separate constructor, emitted ONLY by the C-family
  exporter path, keeps that choice explicit rather than baked into a single shared
  node's semantics.

  `Val.beq`/`applyBinop`/every existing `Val` match are untouched: the OPERAND and
  RESULT are ordinary `Val.str`/`Val.int` values already known throughout Core, this
  only adds one more way to produce an `Int` from a `Val.str`'s own content. Reads at
  the string's own length (one past its last real character) yield `0`, matching C's
  own implicit null terminator that a `Val.str` does not literally store; any other
  out-of-range index is a hole, not a guessed value, since indexing past a C string's
  terminator is undefined behaviour with no single well-defined answer to encode.
  Indexes by Lean `String` codepoint, not raw UTF-8 byte -- identical for the ASCII
  content this project's own string literals are built from, and stated here rather
  than silently assumed. -/
  | strByte : Expr → Expr → Expr
  /-- `009-reduce-remaining-holes-4`: the substring of `a` starting at position `b`,
  through its end -- Python's own `s[i:]`, and the value a C byte-cursor `char *z`
  (`Expr.strByte`, just above) has to produce when it is passed WHOLE to another
  function partway through being walked (`parseHhMmSs(zDate, p)` after `zDate` has
  already advanced past the date portion -- SQLite's own dominant real shape for a
  walked cursor, confirmed live: the great majority of `const char *` cursor
  parameters are passed onward to a sub-parser at least once). Clamped like Lean's
  own `List.drop`: a negative start is a hole (the exporter never has a genuine
  reason to produce one -- a cursor only ever advances forward), but a start past
  the string's own length is simply the empty string, exactly as `"abc"[10:]` is
  `""` in Python and `s.drop 999` is `[]` in Lean -- no undefined behaviour to
  guard against on that side, unlike `strByte`'s own out-of-range READ. -/
  | strFrom : Expr → Expr → Expr
  /-- **The C address model** (`docs/core-language.md` §2.1): a binary pointer
  operation, evaluated left then right like `binop`, but answered by
  `applyPtrOp` (`Semantics.lean`), which -- unlike `applyBinop` -- reads the HEAP, because
  every rule of C pointer comparison and arithmetic is a statement about the object a
  pointer points into: its extent (one-past-the-end is a valid pointer, two-past is not)
  and, for arithmetic, its element size.

  A C pointer is modelled CompCert-style as a *block plus an offset*: `Val.iref r (.idx i)`
  is element `i` of heap block `r`, `Val.ref r` the whole object `r`, `Val.unit`/`Val.int 0`
  the null pointer, `Val.str s` a `char*` under the string model (the bytes up to the
  terminator, no identity), `Val.fn f` a function. The `String` is the operator:
  `"=="`, `"!="`, `"<"`, `"<="`, `">"`, `">="` (stride-free: comparing two offsets in one
  block never needs the element size), `"+"` / `"-"` (pointer ± integer, left operand
  the pointer) and `"diff"` (pointer − pointer). The `Nat` is the STATIC pointee size in
  bytes at the operation site, which `"+"`/`"-"`/`"diff"` check against the size the
  block was allocated with (`Heap.elemSize`): a pointer that reached here through a
  pointee-changing cast has a different stride, and stepping it by block elements would
  be a wrong answer, so it is a hole. Relations ignore it (the exporter writes `0`).
  Everything C leaves undefined or unspecified is a hole, never a value: see
  `applyPtrOp`. -/
  | ptrOp : String → Nat → Expr → Expr → Expr
  /-- `docs/boxed-containers.md` step 3, Python only: a list or dict DISPLAY (`[a, b]`,
  `{}`) is an OBJECT, not a value. Evaluates its operand -- always an `Expr.listE` or
  `Expr.dictE` at every site the exporter emits -- to a `Val.list`/`Val.dict` and
  allocates a fresh heap object of class `list`/`dict` carrying it as its `Payload`,
  returning the `Val.ref`. Two displays therefore allocate twice, and `b = a` copies the
  REFERENCE, which is what makes `a = b; b[0] = 1; a[0]` observe the write.

  A wrapper rather than a change to `listE`/`dictE` themselves, deliberately: C aggregate
  initializers and JS/Java array literals also translate to `listE`/`dictE`, and those
  keep value semantics (a C struct is copied by value). The dialect split is therefore
  made once, by the exporter, at the one place it knows the source language. -/

/-! ### `==` through the heap

`Val.beq` is structural and heap-free, which is right for scalars and is what makes the
scalar path reducible by `rfl`/`decide` -- `Refine.lean` depends on that. It is NOT right
for containers once they live on the heap: two list objects with equal contents have
different refs, so a structural compare answers `False` where Python answers `True`.

`Val.eqPy` is the heap-aware relation. It is `Option`-valued because it is fuel-indexed:
containers can be cyclic (`a = []; a.append(a)`), and running out of fuel is IGNORANCE, so
it must be `none` and become `outOfFuel`, never `false` -- a `false` there would be a
manufactured divergence on deeply nested values.

Since step 3 of `docs/boxed-containers.md` (Python list/dict displays allocate) it differs
from `Val.beq` exactly where it must: two distinct boxed lists with equal contents are
equal, a boxed list equals an unboxed one with the same contents, and dict equality is
order-insensitive. On scalars it still IS `Val.beq` (`eqPy_agrees_with_beq_on_scalars`).

Note this does NOT re-type `applyBinop`. The design note proposed threading a heap through
it, which is 155 call sites and every reducible scalar lemma in `Refine.lean`. Diverting at
the one call site where a ref can appear costs nothing and leaves that path intact. -/
/-- Fuel for `==`, derived from the HEAP and never from the evaluator's fuel.

This is not a detail. Threading `evalExpr`'s fuel into the comparison makes the value of a
`binop` depend on how much fuel the evaluator had, which breaks `evalExpr_pure_fuel_indep`
outright -- the pure fragment includes `binop`. Deriving it from the heap keeps the
comparison fuel equal across two runs that differ only in evaluator fuel, because the pure
fragment is heap-inert.

`h.length` bounds how far reference-chasing can go before repeating an object; the constant
covers nesting inside VALUE containers, which the heap does not bound. Exceeding it yields
`none`, hence `outOfFuel` -- ignorance, never `false`. -/

/-- What a value iterates over, if anything.

A `str` iterates over its characters as **one-character strings**, as CPython does:
`list("ab") == ['a', 'b']` and `g(*"ab") == ('a', 'b')` under CPython 3.9.6. Core had no
`str` case at all, which made `g(*"ab")` a `TypeError` and `for c in "ab"` a hole — a
measured divergence on extremely common code, recorded as a theorem until this change
and now recorded as agreement (`CallingConvention.str_is_iterable`).

The encoding is character-for-character the one `Stdlib.elems` already used for `str`,
which is what made the omission here a plain inconsistency rather than a design choice:
`list("ab")` worked while `for c in "ab"` did not. `String.toList` is the codepoint
decomposition, so this iterates `Char`s as CPython 3 iterates a `str`, not bytes.

Note the base case: the empty string iterates to `[]`, so `g(*"")` is `()` — matching
CPython — rather than an error, and a `str` case that returned `some []` for *every*
string would satisfy that pin while being useless, which is why the non-empty case is
pinned separately. -/
