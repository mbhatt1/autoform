# Core — a universal deep-embedded imperative language

`Imp` proved the harness works. `Core` is the real target: it is deliberately shaped to
match **Joern's code property graph node vocabulary**, which already normalizes
C/C++/Java/JavaScript/Python/Kotlin/binaries into a single AST schema.

That is the trick for "arbitrary codebase". We do not write one transpiler per language;
we write one semantics for the CPG core and one CPG→Lean exporter, and every
Joern-supported front end comes along for free.

The price is honesty about coverage, which is why holes are first class:

* `Expr.hole` — an unmapped expression, tagged with the CPG node label that produced it.
* `Stmt.hole` — an unmapped statement, likewise.

Nothing is ever silently dropped. The ledger counts holes, and a program with holes
cannot be proved to do anything at the hole. That is the point, not a limitation.

namespace Autoform.Core

/-- Source-language dialect.

**Two constructors were not enough** and this was known (STRATEGY.md §29): six languages
have been run through the pipeline and they disagree on integer width, string semantics,
boolean-operator semantics, and equality. `cLike` used to mean "32-bit truncating C" and
was applied to Java, Go, JavaScript and TypeScript, which are none of those things.
`javascript` is the first constructor added past the original two — for JS/TS
specifically, not for Java/Go, which really do agree with `cLike` on `&&`/`||`
(`Lang.dialect` still routes them there).

**What `javascript` fixes, because it was measured wrong (`docs/languages.md`):**
`&&`/`||` now yield an **operand**, not a coerced boolean (`0 || 5` is `5`, not `true`) —
`boolOpsAreValues := true`, like Python. Arithmetic now uses unbounded integers instead
of 32-bit two's-complement wraparound — `toNumConfig .javascript = NumConfig.python` —
which is the specific fix for the measured bug `2147483647 + 1`: Node reports
`2147483648`, the old `.cLike`-routed Core reported `-2147483648` (wrapped), and unbounded
arithmetic now agrees with Node up to `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (2^53 - 1).

**What `javascript` does NOT fix, named rather than hidden:** real JS numbers are IEEE
doubles, and this project's `Val` has no single "JS number" representation that is
sometimes-int-sometimes-float the way `Number` is — `NumConfig.python`'s *unbounded*
integers are themselves a known-wrong approximation past 2^53 (Numeric.lean already
recorded this before this dialect existed). Untagged bitwise/shift operators also
inherit that unbounded configuration. Fresh Joern exports instead preserve these
operations as `num:js:i32:<op>`; TypedNumeric applies Number coercion to 32 bits.
String/object coercion and BigInt remain outside that subset. General Number
arithmetic still makes `Lang.approximated` true for JavaScript/TypeScript. -/

A C aggregate initializer — `static struct crypto_alg alg = { .cra_name = "842", .
cra_priority = 100 }` — is a finite map from field names to values, which is exactly
`Val.dict` with string keys, and C struct assignment copies, so value semantics is the
right semantics for it. Under a C-family dialect `alg.cra_priority` therefore reads the
key `"cra_priority"` out of that map.

Under Python it must **not**: `{'a': 1}.a` is an `AttributeError`, not `1`, and answering
`1` would be a silent wrong answer of the §12 kind. So `.python` says `false` and the
access stays the `field:a:non-object` hole it has always been.

JavaScript agrees with the C-family answer here, for a different reason: a JS object
literal's fields genuinely are accessible by dot notation (`({a: 1}).a === 1`), so
`.javascript` says `true`, like `.cLike`.

Note what this does *not* buy: a `dict` is not on the heap, so `e.f = v` on one is still
`setField:non-object`. A struct whose fields are written after initialization is a hole,
not a wrong answer. -/

"exact bignum vs. float" comparison to have; `.javascript` says `false`, matching the

  ## Why this shape, and not a payload on `Obj`

  The obvious cheaper alternative is `Obj.builtin : Option Val`, leaving the value a
  `Val.ref`. It does not work, and the reason is structural rather than a matter of
  taste: **`Val.beq`, `applyBinop`, `valIn` and `Val.truthy` do not take the heap.**
  They are pure functions of values, and they are exactly the functions that have to
  agree with the builtin. Making the `Obj` payload visible to them means threading a
  `Heap` through `Val.beq` — which is also the `BEq Val` instance, is used inside
  `Val.beqL`/`beqP`, inside `Stdlib`'s association-list helpers, and inside dozens of
  `Refine.lean` theorems. That is a far larger and more dangerous edit than adding a
  constructor, and it leaves `Val.beq` able to *fail* to consult the heap on any path —
  the silent-wrong failure mode this project keeps finding.

  So the payload lives in the value. There is exactly one copy of an instance's builtin
  state and no way for a value and a heap object to disagree about it.

  ## What this costs, stated plainly

  A `bobj` has **no mutable instance attributes**: it is not on the heap, so `e.f` on one
  is `field:f:non-object` and `e.f = v` is `setField:f:non-object` — holes, not wrong
  answers. `_HashedTuple.__hash__`'s memo field is therefore a hole. Classes with a
  builtin base that define `__init__` or `__eq__` are refused at construction
  (`alloc:builtin-base:...`) rather than silently ignoring them.

  ## What could still silently go wrong

  1. `Val.beq` now compares two `bobj`s, and a `bobj` against a plain builtin, by
     **contents, ignoring the class**. That is CPython's behaviour for `tuple`/`list`/
     `dict`/`str` subclasses that do not override `__eq__` (measured: `A((0,)) ==
     B((0,))` is `True`), and the `__eq__` check at construction is what keeps it true.
     If a future exporter records a builtin base for a class whose `__eq__` it could not
     see, equality would be wrong and nothing here would catch it.
  2. Mutation of a `list`/`dict` base is value-semantics, exactly as Core's own
     containers already are (`setIndex` is `setIndex:immutable-containers`). A `bobj`
     inherits that known unsoundness rather than adding a new one — see
     `docs/boxed-containers.md`.
  3. Any `match` on `Val` with a catch-all that predates this constructor will treat a
     `bobj` as "some other value". Every such site in `Semantics.lean` and `Stdlib.lean`
     was audited; a site added later will not be. -/

  source -- its length is fixed at EXPORT time, which is exactly why a large
  compile-time-sized array (SQLite's own I/O buffers run 512-8,192 elements) blows
  the elaborator's recursion depth or exhausts memory (`research.md` §3, spec 010's
  own Day-1 finding): the SOURCE FILE itself contains one nested list cell per

  `Expr.boxArray` sidesteps this by construction: it takes a single length
  EXPRESSION, evaluates it ONCE at runtime to a `Val.int`, and the resulting `Obj`'s
  fields (`"0" ↦ .unit, "1" ↦ .unit, ..., "n-1" ↦ .unit`, `List.range` under the

  whatever `Nat` the interpreter computes THEN -- no per-element syntax, so no
  elaboration-time cost that scales with the array's size at all, compile-time-known
  or not. This is what makes it usable for `malloc(len)`-shaped C allocations, whose
  size the exporter can never know until the program runs: `zOut = malloc(n);` seeds
  `zOut` as `Val.ref` to a fresh `n`-field `Obj`, `Val.iref` (`Sel.idx`, already
  generic over the position) then walks and reads/writes it exactly like any other
  boxed array -- `irefIndex`/`derefIref`/`setDerefIref`/pointer arithmetic on
  `Val.iref` need no change at all, only a new way to OBTAIN a valid ref to something
  shaped like one. Every field starts `.unit`, matching every other uninitialized

  fundamentally NOT `Expr.index`'s existing meaning. `Expr.index` on a `.str` receiver
  has no case in `evalExpr` at all today (confirmed by reading it directly): Python's
  own `s[i]` returns a length-1 `Val.str` (matching CPython), but C's `*p` needs an
  INTEGER byte value comparable via arithmetic (`*z == '"'`, `*z - '0'`) -- the two
  languages want different return types from the identical `a[b]` syntax, so one
  semantics cannot honestly serve both. Giving `Expr.index` a `.str` case that returns
  an integer would silently mistranslate the (currently unsupported, so not yet relied
  on by anything) Python shape; a separate constructor, emitted ONLY by the C-family
  exporter path, keeps that choice explicit rather than baked into a single shared
  node's semantics.

  `Val.beq`/`applyBinop`/every existing `Val` match are untouched: the OPERAND and
  RESULT are ordinary `Val.str`/`Val.int` values already known throughout Core, this
  only adds one more way to produce an `Int` from a `Val.str`'s own content. Reads at
  the string's own length (one past its last real character) yield `0`, matching C's
  own implicit null terminator that a `Val.str` does not literally store; any other
  out-of-range index is a hole, not a guessed value, since indexing past a C string's
  terminator is undefined behaviour with no single well-defined answer to encode.
  Indexes by Lean `String` codepoint, not raw UTF-8 byte -- identical for the ASCII
  content this project's own string literals are built from, and stated here rather
  than silently assumed. -/

  /-- `009-reduce-remaining-holes-4`: the substring of `a` starting at position `b`,
  through its end -- Python's own `s[i:]`, and the value a C byte-cursor `char *z`
  (`Expr.strByte`, just above) has to produce when it is passed WHOLE to another
  function partway through being walked (`parseHhMmSs(zDate, p)` after `zDate` has
  already advanced past the date portion -- SQLite's own dominant real shape for a
  walked cursor, confirmed live: the great majority of `const char *` cursor
  parameters are passed onward to a sub-parser at least once). Clamped like Lean's
  own `List.drop`: a negative start is a hole (the exporter never has a genuine
  reason to produce one -- a cursor only ever advances forward), but a start past
  the string's own length is simply the empty string, exactly as `"abc"[10:]` is
  `""` in Python and `s.drop 999` is `[]` in Lean -- no undefined behaviour to
  guard against on that side, unlike `strByte`'s own out-of-range READ. -/

/-- A parameter default Core can bind without function-object state.

Both forms are **time-invariant**: their value does not depend on when they are
evaluated and evaluating them has no effect, which is the property that lets a default be
bound at call time rather than at definition time. A literal is obvious; a reference to an
in-program function is the same argument -- `def f(k=keys.hashkey)` stores the function
object, and that object is the same whenever it is looked up.

Anything else -- a call, a mutable literal, an attribute of something that can be
rebound -- is NOT time-invariant and the definition still holes. Keeping this a closed

here. `DefaultValue.toVal` is total and heap-free, and `bindParams` folds it without a
heap, which is what every accessor theorem's `hdef : fn.literalDefaults = []` and the
reducible calling-convention proofs rest on. A class attribute has no heap-free value, so
it lives in `PythonSignature.classAttrDefaults` and is resolved by `applyFunc`, which has
the heap. Two fields with one job each, rather than one field whose `toVal` is partial. -/

  Python evaluates a default expression once, when the `def` executes, and stores the
  result on the function object. Core has no function-object state, so in general a
  default cannot be modelled and the exporter holes the definition
  (`call:python-defaults`). A *literal* default is the case where that machinery is not
  needed: its value does not depend on when it is evaluated and evaluating it has no
  effect, so binding it at call time is indistinguishable from binding it at definition
  time. Restricting the field to `Lit` is what makes that argument checkable by the type
  rather than by convention — a default that is a name, an attribute or any other
  expression cannot be written here, and still holes.

  Empty for every function without defaults, which is why every already-rendered corpus
  keeps its meaning: `bindParams` folds an empty list into the base environment and
  reduces to exactly the term it had before. -/

  `(parameter, class short name, mangled attribute name)`, so `def pop(self, key,

  Not a `DefaultValue`, on purpose: its value is on the heap, and reading it is what
  `applyFunc` does -- `bindParams` stays heap-free. The value is time-invariant in the way
  a literal is (the class attribute is bound once, when the class body runs, and re-read
  at call time gives the same object), which is what lets it be bound at call time; the
  common case is a sentinel, `__marker = object()`, whose entire meaning is "an object no
  caller can pass", and identity is exactly what a fresh heap cell has.

/-! ### `==` through the heap

`Val.beq` is structural and heap-free, which is right for scalars and is what makes the
scalar path reducible by `rfl`/`decide` -- `Refine.lean` depends on that. It is NOT right
for containers once they live on the heap: two list objects with equal contents have
different refs, so a structural compare answers `False` where Python answers `True`.

`Val.eqPy` is the heap-aware relation. It is `Option`-valued because it is fuel-indexed:
containers can be cyclic (`a = []; a.append(a)`), and running out of fuel is IGNORANCE, so
it must be `none` and become `outOfFuel`, never `false` -- a `false` there would be a
manufactured divergence on deeply nested values.

**At this step it agrees with `Val.beq` everywhere**, because every payload is `.none`, so
two distinct refs are two distinct plain objects and compare `false` exactly as before. The
ref case is written out now so that step 3 of `docs/boxed-containers.md` -- container
literals allocating -- needs no change here.

Note this does NOT re-type `applyBinop`. The design note proposed threading a heap through
it, which is 155 call sites and every reducible scalar lemma in `Refine.lean`. Diverting at
the one call site where a ref can appear costs nothing and leaves that path intact. -/
/-- Fuel for `==`, derived from the HEAP and never from the evaluator's fuel.

This is not a detail. Threading `evalExpr`'s fuel into the comparison makes the value of a
`binop` depend on how much fuel the evaluator had, which breaks `evalExpr_pure_fuel_indep`
outright -- the pure fragment includes `binop`. Deriving it from the heap keeps the
comparison fuel equal across two runs that differ only in evaluator fuel, because the pure
fragment is heap-inert.

`h.length` bounds how far reference-chasing can go before repeating an object; the constant
covers nesting inside VALUE containers, which the heap does not bound. Exceeding it yields
`none`, hence `outOfFuel` -- ignorance, never `false`. -/

Only one layer is ever needed: `Expr.alloc` never builds a `bobj` whose payload is itself
a `bobj` (the payload is coerced to the declared base first).

Deliberately **non-recursive**. Every consumer below unwraps with this rather than
recursing on `Val`, which keeps `Val.truthy`, `Val.iterable` and `Stdlib.elems`
non-recursive matchers: making them recursive compiles them through `brecOn`, and the

/-- What a value iterates over, if anything.

A `str` iterates over its characters as **one-character strings**, as CPython does:
`list("ab") == ['a', 'b']` and `g(*"ab") == ('a', 'b')` under CPython 3.9.6. Core had no
`str` case at all, which made `g(*"ab")` a `TypeError` and `for c in "ab"` a hole — a
measured divergence on extremely common code, recorded as a theorem until this change
and now recorded as agreement (`CallingConvention.str_is_iterable`).

The encoding is character-for-character the one `Stdlib.elems` already used for `str`,
which is what made the omission here a plain inconsistency rather than a design choice:
`list("ab")` worked while `for c in "ab"` did not. `String.toList` is the codepoint
decomposition, so this iterates `Char`s as CPython 3 iterates a `str`, not bytes.

Note the base case: the empty string iterates to `[]`, so `g(*"")` is `()` — matching
CPython — rather than an error, and a `str` case that returned `some []` for *every*
string would satisfy that pin while being useless, which is why the non-empty case is
pinned separately. -/
