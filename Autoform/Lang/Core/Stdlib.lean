# Core — a modelled standard library

## Why this file exists

The `cachetools` ledger reads

    hole-free (upper bound) : 149 / 238 functions
    verifiable core         :  45 / 238 functions   (hole-free AND call-closed)

The 104-function difference is functions that contain no holes of their own but call
something that does not exist inside the translated program. Counting the unresolved
callee names over `ast-Cachetools.json` says what they are: Python builtins (`len`,
`sorted`, `tuple`, `callable`, `getattr`), exception constructors (`KeyError`,
`ValueError`, ...), and container methods (`get`, `items`, `append`, `pop`, `update`).

A function is only as analysable as its callees, so this is the largest single lever on
the verifiable core. This file supplies the callees.

## The rule this file is written under

**Model behaviour faithfully or return `none`.**

`none` means "not a modelled builtin", and the caller falls through to the existing
`call:<name>` / `mcall:<name>` hole — a *visible* gap, which the ledger counts and the
SACM case declares. A wrong model is the opposite: a silent wrong answer, which is the
failure mode `STRATEGY.md` §12, §19 and §26 exist to prevent, and which this project has
already been bitten by four times (floored `%`, bitwise `and`/`or`, C string `+`, private
name mangling). Every builtin below therefore returns `none` on argument shapes whose
Python behaviour Core cannot represent, rather than picking a plausible answer.

## Dialect

Everything here is **Python**. Under `.cLike` every entry point returns `none`
(`builtin_cLike_none`, `method_cLike_none` below): C has no `len`, and C's library
(`strlen`, `malloc`, `abs` on `INT_MIN`) has different semantics that would need their
own modelling pass. Answering a C program with Python's builtins is exactly the class of
error that made the semantics dialect-parameterized in the first place.

## What is deliberately NOT modelled, and why

* `super()` — needs an MRO. Core has one class *name* per object and no inheritance
  graph, so there is nothing to compute a proxy from.
* `hash()` — CPython's `hash` is implementation-defined and, for `str`/`bytes`,
  randomized per process by PYTHONHASHSEED. Any concrete value would diverge from the
  conformance oracle by construction.
* `set()` / `frozenset()` — Core has no unordered-collection value. Returning `Val.list`
  would make ordering and `==` observable where Python makes them not, and would make
  `set([1,2]) == set([2,1])` false.
* `iter()` / `next()` — an iterator is *stateful*. A `Val.list` snapshot makes repeated
  `next(it)` on the same variable return the same element forever, which is a wrong
  answer, not a missing one. Needs an iterator value in `Syntax.lean`.
* `type()` — Core has no type objects. `Val.fn` names live in the function-table
  namespace, not the builtin-type namespace, so `type(x) == int` would silently answer
  `False`. (`isinstance` is modelled only for the cases where the answer is certain.)
* `id()` — CPython interns small ints and some strings; identity of non-objects is not
  something Core can commit to.
* `range()`, `enumerate()`, `zip()`, `map()`, `filter()`, `reversed()` — lazy views.
  Same objection as `iter`, plus `range(3) == [0,1,2]` is `False` in Python.
* `str()` / `repr()` on strings and containers — see `Exceptions are strings` below.
* `float`, `bytes`, `complex` — no corresponding `Val`.
* `getattr`/`hasattr` on an *absent* attribute — Python consults the class, the MRO and
  `__getattr__`; Core's heap only has instance fields, so absence is unknown, not `False`.

## Two assumptions this file makes, stated so a reviewer can find them

1. **Exceptions are strings.** `Semantics.lean` already raises `.exn (.str "KeyError")`
   from `numToE` and from `index`, so exception *constructors* here produce
   `.val (.str "KeyError")` for consistency — which **drops the payload**. `KeyError(k)`
   and `KeyError(j)` are therefore indistinguishable, and `e.args` / `str(e)` are not
   faithful. Because an exception value and an ordinary string are the same `Val`, `str`
   and `repr` are modelled *only* on `.int` and `.bool`, so that this file never claims
   `str(e) = "KeyError"`.
2. **Mutating methods assume the receiver is not aliased.** Core containers are values,
   not boxed objects, so `xs.append(v)` cannot write through a reference. Those methods
   are returned under a **separate constructor**, `MethodResult.mutating`, carrying the
   updated receiver for the caller to store back. See the warning on `method` before
   wiring them.

/-! ## Association-list helpers, shared with `Val.dict`

`Val.dict` is an association list in **insertion order** (CPython 3.7+ guarantees that
order, and `Semantics.evalExpr` resolves `index` by first match). Writing a key must
therefore *replace in place* when the key is present and *append* when it is not —
appending unconditionally would shadow correctly but change `len`, `keys` and iteration
order. -/

`evalExpr` uses for `Expr.index`. -/

Only all-`int` and all-`str` lists are sorted. Python's `sorted` is defined by `<` on the
elements: on mixed or non-scalar element types it either raises `TypeError` or compares
by an order Core does not have, so those return `none`. `List.mergeSort` is stable, which
matches CPython. `Char` order is by code point in both languages, so lexicographic
`String` order agrees. -/

/-! ## Exceptions

`Semantics.numToE` raises `.exn (.str "ZeroDivisionError")` and `evalExpr` raises
`.exn (.str "KeyError")`, so an exception in Core *is* the string naming its class.
Constructors follow that convention — see assumption 1 in the module docstring. -/

  -- `isinstance(A((0,)), tuple)` is `True` in CPython for `class A(tuple)`. The *class's

type. `bool` is a subclass of `int`, which is why `isinstance(True, int)` is `True`.

`None`" with "there is no such attribute". `getattr` must not: absence in Python consults

/-! ### The name predicate, and why it is a *guard* rather than a list

The ledger needs to know which callee names this file answers, so that `Ctx.resolvable`
counts a modelled builtin as resolved. The obvious implementation is a hand-written list
of names beside the implementation — and a hand-written list beside an implementation is
exactly how a coverage metric starts lying, which is §17's whole subject.

So the list is not *beside* the implementation, it is *in front of* it: `builtin` is
`builtinCore` guarded by `knowsFree`, and every name `knowsFree` rejects is `none` **by
construction**, not by a theorem that could rot. Adding a case to `builtinCore` without
adding its name to `freeNames` makes that case dead code rather than making the ledger
overstate. `builtin_none_of_not_knowsFree` below is then true by `rfl`.

The other direction — every name in `freeNames` really is answered — *can* rot, so it is
proved by evaluation against a witness argument list (`knowsFree_complete`). -/

/-- Every free name this file answers under `.python`: the exception constructors plus
the modelled builtins. -/

  , "list", "tuple", "dict" ]

/-- Does `builtin` model this free-function name under this dialect?

**Exact**, not an upper bound: `knowsFree d n = true` iff `builtin d _ n _` answers for
*some* arguments (`knowsFree_complete` / `builtin_none_of_not_knowsFree`). It is still
only an upper bound on whether a *particular* call is answered, since `str` is modelled
on `.int` but not on `.str` — that residue is `dynamic-hole risk`, exactly like the
`field`/`index` cases the ledger already counts there. -/

/-! ## Container methods

`Expr.mcall` currently holes with `mcall:<m>:non-object` whenever the receiver is not a
`Val.ref` — which is every list, tuple, dict and string. This is the other half of the
gap.

### Read the warning before wiring the mutating half

Python containers are boxed and shared; Core's are values. `MethodResult.mutating`
therefore hands the caller the *new receiver value* rather than performing a write, and
it is only faithful when the receiver is not aliased:

    a = []; b = a; b.append(1)      -- Python: `a` is [1].  Value writeback: `a` is [].

Worse, on this corpus the CPG has already desugared `self.__data.pop(k)` into
`tmp0 = self.__data; tmp0.pop(k)`, so writing back to the receiver *expression* updates a
temporary and the object is untouched. **The honest wiring is to treat `.mutating` as a
hole (`mcall:<m>:unboxed-container`) until `Syntax.lean` grows a boxed container**, and to
use the `.pure` half now. The mutating cases are implemented here so that the boxed
version is a change of plumbing rather than of semantics — not because they are ready.

consulted **only after** the interpreter's own class dispatch fails, so a user class with
a `get` or `pop` method always wins — those names are ambiguous by design.

String methods are not modelled at all: an exception value and a string are the same

/-- Does `method` model this method name under this dialect?

**This one is an upper bound, and you should treat it as one.** Unlike `knowsFree` it
cannot be exact, because a method is modelled per *receiver shape*, and the ledger is a
static analysis that does not know receivers: `pop` is answered on a `.list` and a
`.dict` and refused on a `.str`, `.tuple` or `.ref`. A bare name predicate necessarily
says `true` for all three.

That is the same kind of claim `Ctx.resolve` already makes for user functions — a name
that resolves statically can still hole at runtime — so using this in `Ctx.resolvable`
does not introduce a *new* category of overstatement. But it does add to it, and the
residue belongs in `dynamic-hole risk`, which is the number §17 built for exactly this.

If you want a predicate with no slack at all, use `answersMethod` below: it is decided by
the real function against the real receiver, so it cannot overstate and cannot drift. It
is only usable where the receiver value is in hand — the interpreter, or the conformance
harness, not the static ledger. -/
def knowsMethod (d : Dialect) (name : String) : Bool :=
  match d with
  | .cLike  => false
  | .python => methodNames.contains name

/-- Methods on non-object receivers, for `Expr.mcall`. Guarded by `knowsMethod` for the
same reason `builtin` is guarded by `knowsFree`. -/
def method (d : Dialect) (h : Heap) (recv : Val) (name : String) (args : List Val) :
    Option (Heap × MethodResult) :=
  if knowsMethod d name then methodCore d h recv name args else none

/-- The exact, receiver-aware version of `knowsMethod`: decided by `method` itself, so it
is sound and complete by definition and cannot drift. -/
def answersMethod (d : Dialect) (h : Heap) (recv : Val) (name : String)

/-! ## Properties

Only what closes cheaply and independently. Each is stated in terms other than the
definition it checks wherever that was possible — a lemma that restates its subject is
the vacuity `STRATEGY.md` §14 and the mutation gate exist to catch. -/

/-- The whole table is Python-only: no C program can be answered by a Python builtin. -/

    method .cLike h r n as = none := rfl


/-! ### The name predicates the ledger consumes

`Ctx.resolvable` must count a modelled builtin as a resolved callee, or the verifiable
core is understated. These are the predicates for that. The soundness direction — the one
that stops the ledger *overstating* — holds by construction, because `builtin` and
`method` are the guarded wrappers, not the implementations. -/

/-- No C program is answered by a Python builtin, at the predicate level too. -/
@[simp] theorem knowsFree_cLike (n : String) : knowsFree .cLike n = false := rfl

/-- Likewise for methods. -/
@[simp] theorem knowsMethod_cLike (n : String) : knowsMethod .cLike n = false := rfl

/-- **The direction that matters.** A name the predicate rejects is never answered, so a
ledger built on `knowsFree` can only understate, never overstate. True by `rfl` under the
hypothesis: `builtin` *is* `builtinCore` behind this guard. -/

/-! The completeness direction — every listed name really is answered — is the one that
can rot as the implementation changes, so it is not asserted, it is *evaluated*. Each
name is applied to a witness argument list and the whole table is checked by the kernel.
Delete a case from `builtinCore` and leave its name in `freeNames`, and this fails. -/
