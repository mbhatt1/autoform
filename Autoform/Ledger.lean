# Trust ledger

The deliverable is never "your codebase is verified". It is a precise statement of what
was translated, what was assumed, and what remains — so a reader can locate the trust
boundary in seconds.

Evidence types here are the domain-specific part (§10 of `STRATEGY.md`); the argument
structure they feed is SACM's, not ours.

## Static hole-freedom is an upper bound, not a guarantee

`Func.total` (no `Expr.hole`/`Stmt.hole` in the AST) was being reported as "the verifiable
core". Testing showed that claim is too strong: the *interpreter* can introduce holes at
runtime that static counting cannot see.

    def sneaky  := .ret (.field (.name "x") "attr")   -- Func.total = true
    run sneaky 3  ==>  hole "field:attr:non-object"
    run sneaky2 3 ==>  hole "call:not_translated"     -- unresolved call, statically invisible
    run sneaky3 3 ==>  hole "index:unsupported"

The worst of the three is `call:` — a call to a function that was never translated looks
identical, in the AST, to a call to one that was. So the headline coverage number
overstated the verifiable core, and this refines it.

Three tiers are now reported, weakest claim first:

* **hole-free** — no static holes. An upper bound on what could be verified.
* **call-closed** — hole-free *and* every call/method target resolves inside the program.
  Removes the invisible-`call:` failure mode.
* **dynamic-hole risk** — constructs (`field`, `index`, `mcall`, arithmetic that can hit
  `ub`) that can still produce a hole on some input. Reported as a count, not subtracted,
  because whether they *do* is input-dependent and belongs to the conformance oracle.

/-- Calls in this function, each tagged with the dispatch path the interpreter will
take: `true` for a method call (`mcall`, resolved by `Ctx.resolveMethod`), `false` for a

/-- Can the interpreter resolve this callee, on the path it will actually take?

Must mirror what `evalExpr` actually does — neither stricter nor looser. The two call
paths do not agree, and collapsing them is how this went wrong twice in opposite
directions:

* **Too strict.** `Ctx.resolve` requires a *unique* suffix match, and applying that rule
  to method calls reported `clear` (9 candidate methods), `__init__` (22) and `pop` (3)
  as unresolvable while the interpreter dispatches them fine — understating the core by
  14 functions. A ledger stricter than the artifact it describes is wrong in the *safe*
  direction, which makes it easy to leave unnoticed, but it still hides the real gap.

* **Too loose.** The fix for that applied `resolveMethod`'s first-match rule to *free*
  calls as well, and `scripts/core_oracle.py` refuted it by execution: `_wrapper` and
  `cache_clear` have several definitions, so the ledger called them resolvable while
  `Ctx.resolve` — which the `call` path really uses — returns `none` on the ambiguity and
  the interpreter holes. That loosening is most of why the claimed core jumped 45 → 74.

So the predicate now takes the dispatch tag from `Func.calls` and answers per path. -/

/-! ## Making call closure linear instead of quadratic

`Ctx.resolvable` calls `Ctx.resolve`, which scans the whole function table on every miss.
The ledger asks it once per call site, so computing call closure is O(callsites × table)
— 363 s on a 10k-function corpus.

The obvious fix, a `HashMap` field on `Ctx`, is **not available**: the proofs in
`Autoform/Contracts.lean`, `Autoform/Refine.lean` and `Autoform/CallingConvention.lean`
`simp` through `Ctx.resolve.go` on the association list, so the list shape is load-bearing
for the kernel. So the index lives *here*, is built once per program, and `Ctx.resolve`
itself is untouched — a `git diff` of `Semantics.lean` shows no change to it.

An index is only a speedup if it computes the same answer. It would be very easy for this
one to quietly disagree with `Ctx.resolvable` and inflate the verifiable core, which is
the exact §17/§30 failure this project keeps catching, so:

* the equivalence argument is written out below, in terms of `String.endsWith`;
* `Program.callClosureAgrees` re-derives the answer *both* ways and compares, and
  `#guard`s at the bottom of this file run it on real corpora at elaboration time. A
  disagreement is a build failure, not a silent number.

**The equivalence.** `Ctx.resolve n` looks for an exact key, then for a *unique* key with
`k.endsWith ("." ++ n)`. For a key `k` split on `"."` into `p₀ … pₘ`, the strings `k` ends
with after a dot are exactly the rejoined tails `p₁…pₘ`, `p₂…pₘ`, …, `pₘ` — one per dot,
all of different lengths, so a single key contributes each candidate `n` at most once.
Therefore `suffixCount[n]` counts *keys*, and:

* `(ctx.resolve n).isSome  ↔  exact.contains n ∨ suffixCount[n] = 1`
* `ctx.table.any (·.1.endsWith ("." ++ n))  ↔  suffixCount[n] ≥ 1`

which is what `ResolveIndex.resolvable` evaluates. -/
