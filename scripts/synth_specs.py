"""Layer 4 — automatic specification synthesis (STRATEGY.md §4).

Every specification about translated code in this repository is hand-written today, which
does not scale past a demo. This script generates them, working *down* §4's list of
sources by descending trustworthiness rather than jumping to invention:

  1. **Existing artifacts** — docstrings carried through the AST, `assert`/`raise` guards,
     doctests, and above all the repository's own test suite, whose executions are
     recorded by `scripts/differential.py`'s trace hook. §15 measured that a repo's own
     property-based tests are the highest-yield source; here the suite plays that role,
     and the outcome CPython produced for each recorded call is a fact this system did
     not manufacture.
  2. **Structural / safety specs, free for all code** — for a function in the call-closed
     core, "on this domain the interpreter returns a value, never `.hole` and never
     `.outOfFuel`" is a real, provable, non-trivial property: `Refine.lean`'s `Outcome`
     has no constructor for either.
  3. **Algebraic laws mined from behaviour** — constancy, projection, identity,
     idempotence, involutivity, commutativity, range bounds, heap purity. Mined from
     observed executions, then *pruned by a refutation pass* over a fuzzed domain before
     anything is emitted.
  4. **Cross-implementation equivalence** — the conformance family: the Lean interpreter
     reproduces what CPython did, stated as a kernel-checked theorem rather than a test
     report.

## The non-negotiable part

§15 measured that **41% of FVSpec's 9,415 LLM-transpiled specs are vacuous** under static
screening, dominated by determinism properties (`f(x) == f(x)`) that become `rfl` in a
pure setting. This generator is built so that it can be measured the same way and report
the number honestly:

* every candidate is **refuted before it is emitted** — mined laws are evaluated over a
  fuzzed domain in the Lean semantics, and a single counterexample drops the candidate;
* every survivor passes a **vacuity screen** with the same check names §15 used
  (`reflexive_conclusion`, `trivial_conclusion`, `empty_quantification`,
  `dependency_vacuity`, `opaque_subject`), and the flagged fraction is reported as *this
  generator's own vacuity rate*;
* a `Deterministic` family is mined deliberately and then rejected in full, so the number
  §15 found dominant is measured here rather than assumed absent;
* nothing is admitted. Statements that cannot be proved are emitted as `Prop`-valued
  `def`s plus `OpenObligation` records. There is no `sorry` anywhere — `scripts/audit_all.py`
  audits for it.

Both anti-vacuity gates run on the output: the emitted module ends with `#audit_depends`
for every theorem (so a statement that never mentions the generated implementation fails
the *build*), and the module is a valid target for
`scripts/mutate.py Autoform/Generated/<M>.lean Autoform.Generated.<M>
 --spec-file Autoform/SpecsGen/<M>.lean --spec-module Autoform.SpecsGen.<M>`.

Usage:

# Value generation is Hypothesis's job, not ours. The hand-rolled version drew ints from
# a seven-element list (`[0, 1, -1, 2, 7, -7, 1000000]`) and strings from three shapes
# (`""`, `"x"`, `v + "!"`). Hypothesis's `integers()` already knows to probe 0, +/-1, and
# the machine-word and 64-bit boundaries -- the exact edges `Numeric.lean` models and the
# exact edges a hand-written list forgets -- and `text()` probes empty, whitespace and
# non-ASCII. `derandomize=True` keeps a run reproducible, which the refutation record
# depends on: a counterexample nobody can regenerate is not evidence.
#
# Hypothesis's shrinking is deliberately NOT used. Shrinking needs a per-example verdict,
# and the verdict here comes from a batched Lean elaboration of 120 candidates at a time
# (`refute`, below); asking Lean once per shrink step would cost hours. So Hypothesis is
# used as a generator and the batch oracle is kept. Counterexamples are therefore not
# minimal, and that is a real limitation of this script, not a solved problem.

# 3b. Synthetic domains — the corpora with no CPython to trace
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Everything above this point takes its domain from `differential.py`'s trace hook, which
# means it takes its domain from *CPython*. That is the right source when the corpus is
# Python and it is the only source the generator has ever had — which is exactly why
# every theorem in this repository is about one Python library. V8 and Linux have no
# CPython to trace: there is no interpreter of ours that can run `bits.cc`, and a
# recorded call for a C++ function is not something this repository can honestly produce.
#
# So the domain is *synthesized* instead: arguments drawn from the same Hypothesis pools
# the fuzzer already uses, typed by the C/C++ signature carried in the function's name.
# What this buys and what it costs, stated plainly:
#
#   * `conform_*` is impossible here and is NOT generated. A cross-runtime theorem needs
#     the other runtime. Emitting one against outcomes this system computed itself would
#     be the interpreter agreeing with itself — the precise failure the family exists to
#     avoid. The synthetic families are structural (§4.2) and algebraic (§4.3) only.
#   * `const_*`, `raises_*` and `projects_*` are also not generated: all three are *mined
#     from observed outcomes*, and there are none.
#   * Everything else is unchanged, including every anti-vacuity gate: a law is still
#     refuted against its domain before emission, still dropped if any case holes, still
#     screened, and still has to survive the `≠ outOfFuel` guard to be lifted off `FUEL`.
#
# One gate is *added* for this mode. With a recorded domain, a law about an argument was
# at least about an argument some caller really passed. With a synthesized one, a
# function that ignores its parameters satisfies `commutes` and `idempotent` trivially,
# so the screen below requires the subject to actually mention the parameter the law is
# about (`argument_insensitive`).

# 6b. Characterization: what the translated function actually computes
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Measured, not assumed: the mutation gate (`scripts/mutate.py`, the *sufficient* half of
# the anti-vacuity check) rated the structural families WEAK on Linux. `lawRuns` and
# `lawReturns` forbid only `.hole` and `.outOfFuel`, and most mutations of a body preserve
# both — `radix_tree_tagged` with its two arguments swapped still returns a value, so the
# theorem still proves and the mutant survives. On cachetools the family with teeth was
# `conform_*`, which pins the exact outcome; C and C++ corpora have no runtime this
# repository can drive, so that family does not exist for them.
#
# This is the honest replacement, and its name is chosen so that it can never be mistaken
# for the other one:
#
#   * `conform_*` says *CPython produced this*. It is cross-implementation evidence.
#   * `charact_*` says *this translation computes this*. It is a **characterization**
#     (regression) theorem. The right-hand side is this system's own output, so it is
#     emphatically NOT evidence that the translation is faithful to C, and the report
#     records it under a separate key for exactly that reason.
#
# What it is good for is the thing the structural families are bad at: it pins every bit
# of the result, so any mutation of the subject that changes what it computes breaks the
# proof. A specification that cannot be broken by breaking the code is worthless, and this
# is how the C corpora get one at all.
#
# Anti-vacuity, unchanged: a case whose result is `.hole` or `.outOfFuel` is dropped
# (`EResult.beq .outOfFuel .outOfFuel` is `true`, which is the vacuity this whole file is
# organised against), a subject with nothing left is dropped, and the `≠ outOfFuel` guard
# still has to pass before the theorem is lifted off `FUEL`.

# Synthesized specifications — `%(module)s`

**Generated by `scripts/synth_specs.py`. Do not edit by hand.**

Every statement below is about `Autoform/Generated/%(module)s.lean` *by import*, so a
mutation of the generated module is a mutation of the subject of these theorems
(`scripts/mutate.py --spec-file`). The `#audit_depends` block at the end fails the build
for any theorem that does not mention the implementation it claims to constrain.

What each family claims, in the order of `STRATEGY.md` §4:

* `conform_*` (§4.4, cross-implementation) — the interpreter reproduces, case by case,
  the outcome **CPython** produced when the repository's own test suite called this
  function. The right-hand sides were recorded by `scripts/differential.py`'s trace hook;
  they are not this system's own output, which is what keeps the family from being an
  elaborate `rfl`.
* `runs_*` / `returns_*` (§4.2, structural) — on this domain the interpreter neither
  reaches an untranslated construct nor exhausts its fuel. `EResult` distinguishes
  `.hole` and `.outOfFuel` from behaviour, so this is a real property, and it is stated
  only for functions whose AST *could* violate it.
* `heappure_*`, `const_*`, `projects_*`, `identity_*`, `idempotent_*`, `involutive_*`,
  `commutes_*`, `nonneg_*` (§4.3, algebraic) — laws mined from observed executions and
  **refuted against a fuzzed domain before emission**. Survivors only.
* `uconst_*`, `uproj_*` — universally quantified refinements, proved for every input and
  every fuel budget above a stated bound.

Domains are finite and explicit, and the theorems about them are proved by computation.
That is deliberate: a kernel-checked test is a test whose axiom basis is auditable and
whose subject a mutation gate can attack.

**Fuel.** A law checked at one budget is a weaker claim than it looks, so each law here is
stated as `∀ fuel, FUEL ≤ fuel → …` wherever that could be *proved*: checked at `FUEL` by
computation and transported by `Autoform/FuelMono.lean`'s `applyFunc_fuel_mono`. That
transport needs two side conditions, both discharged rather than assumed — the context is
`tryFinally`-free (`C_tfFree`, by computation over the function table) and the run did not
end in `outOfFuel` (the `g…` guard, evaluated over the same domain as the law). Where
either fails, the theorem stays at `FUEL` and its generalization is recorded in
`obligations` below as a `Prop`-valued `def` — a statement, not an admission.

There is no `sorry` in this file.

Counts for this run are in `Autoform/SpecsGen/report.json`.
