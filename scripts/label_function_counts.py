"""For each hole label, how many functions would become FULLY hole-free if that ONE
label were fixed -- not merely how many functions contain it somewhere.

The earlier version of this script counted "how many functions carry this label at
all," which sounded like the same "how many functions would this unblock" question
but silently wasn't: a function that carries the label ALONGSIDE nine others stays
holing regardless of what happens to this one label, yet still added to that count --
diluting every label's number with credit it cannot actually deliver on its own, and
in practice made two very differently-productive labels (fixing one clears a function
outright; fixing the other barely dents it) look equally worth chasing. Confirmed
live this session: fixing `op:cast:pointer:int-to-pointer` in several already-messy
functions (`exprAnalyze`, `sqlite3_randomness`) removed the label but left hole-free
completely unchanged, because each function had unrelated holes of its own the whole
time -- the OLD count had no way to say that in advance.

`onlyFunctions` answers the sharper question directly: a function counts for a label
ONLY when that label is the function's ENTIRE hole set (one or more OCCURRENCES of
it, zero of anything else) -- i.e. fixing this one label, and nothing else, is
sufficient to move that function into the hole-free column. Ranking labels by this
number instead of raw occurrence count or "touches" points at the next fix that
actually pays off in hole-free functions, not just in shrinking a hole tally.

Reads the SAME `ast-<Module>.json` `autoform.sh`/`run_one_background` already save at
the repo root (no new CPG walk, no re-running the pipeline).

Usage:
    python3 scripts/label_function_counts.py ast-Sqlite.json
    python3 scripts/label_function_counts.py ast-Sqlite.json --merge-into ledger-Sqlite.json

With --merge-into, writes the result into that ledger JSON's own
"holesByLabelOnlyFunctionCount" field (creating it if absent) and rewrites the file
in place -- the same file `load_ledger()`/the notebook's own pipeline already
produces, so the merged field survives a normal `load_ledger(...)` call with no extra
step.
