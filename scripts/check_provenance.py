"""check_provenance.py — is every Joern-produced artifact traceable to what produced it?

An unchecked provenance record decays into a comment.  This is the check.

It runs from a clean clone with no Joern installed and no `.cpg` anywhere, because every
question it asks is answerable from tracked bytes:

  1. COVERAGE      every tracked `ast-*.json` (and `formalization-graph.json`, if present)
                   has a record, or is named in the unattributed baseline.  A new
                   artifact with no record fails.  An artifact that quietly appears is
                   the failure mode this catches.

                   "tracked" is asked of git, not assumed from the glob.  The large
                   corpora (`ast-Ansible.json`, `ast-LinuxLib.json`, `ast-LinuxCrypto.json`,
                   `ast-V8Base.json`) and `formalization-graph.json` are named in
                   `.gitignore`: they are local build products that a fresh clone does not
                   have at all, so demanding a *committed* provenance record for them was
                   asking the repository to attribute bytes it does not contain.  They are
                   now reported as LOCAL, by name, on every run -- never silently -- and
                   they do not make the gate red.  This is narrower, not looser: the
                   excused set is exactly what a committed `.gitignore` rule excludes, so
                   it is identical in a fresh clone (where the files are simply absent),
                   an artifact that is untracked but NOT ignored is still judged as
                   tracked (the "quietly appeared" case), a LOCAL artifact that DOES carry
                   a record still has that record checked in full, and if git cannot be
                   consulted every artifact is judged as tracked.
  2. INTEGRITY     the record's `artifact_sha256` is the artifact's actual digest.  An
                   artifact regenerated without re-recording fails here.
  3. PIN           the record's `joern_version` equals `joern-version`.  The front end
                   decides the AST; a bump that was not propagated to the artifacts is a
                   silent change of meaning.
  4. EXPORTER      the record's `exporter_sha256` equals the current digest of the Joern
                   script named in it.  This is the check that closes "committed ASTs
                   cannot be regenerated without their CPGs": the `.cpg` files are not
                   tracked, so a committed AST cannot be diffed against a re-export --
                   but the moment `cartographer/export_ast.sc` changes, every AST that
                   predates the change is *mechanically known* to be stale, and the record
                   holds the exact command that regenerates it.
  5. FIELDS        the fields a regeneration needs are present and non-empty.
  6. ORPHANS       no record without an artifact.
  7. BASELINE      an artifact named in the unattributed baseline still has the digest it
                   had when it was baselined.  Regenerate it and the excuse expires; you
                   must record real provenance.

Two things this check deliberately does NOT claim:
  * It does not verify that the recorded command actually reproduces the artifact.  That
    needs Joern, the source tree and ~minutes per corpus; `--verify-source` re-derives
    the recorded `source_revision` when the tree is present, and says so when it is not.
    An unre-derived revision is reported as UNVERIFIED, never counted as verified.
  * A baselined artifact is reported, by name, on every run.  It is a named gap, not a
    pass.  `--strict` refuses to accept the baseline at all.

Usage:  scripts/check_provenance.py [--strict] [--verify-source] [--root .]
                                  [--artifact ast-Module.json ...]
Exit:   0 everything attributed or explicitly baselined; 1 a violation; 2 nothing checked.
