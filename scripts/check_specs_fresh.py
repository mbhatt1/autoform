"""check_specs_fresh.py — is each specification module still about the corpus it was
generated from?

A specification is a statement about a *specific rendering* of a corpus, not about the
project in the abstract. Closing a hole changes what the translated function computes, so
improving coverage can turn a true law false or a false law true. Specs do not rot
gracefully; they invert.

That is not hypothetical. It happened three times in one day:

  * `C_tfFree` asserted the cachetools context contains no `tryFinally`. The exporter
    learned to translate `try/finally`, the assertion became FALSE, and 72 fuel-transported
    laws that rested on it had to be demoted to obligations.
  * Fifteen V8 laws were recorded as refuted. They were evaluated against a module carrying
    55 `op:shiftLeft` holes; the current export has none. Seven of the fifteen are true
    against the current corpus, and the "refutation" described a program that no longer
    existed.
  * A cost of 11 GB was quoted as a property of the fuel transport. It was a property of the
    module layout, and moved by three orders of magnitude when the layout changed.

In every case the specs were internally consistent and the build was green. Nothing tied a
spec to the corpus version it was generated against, so nothing could notice.

This binds them. `artifact-manifest.json` gains a `specs` section recording, per spec
module, the `ast_sha256` of the corpus it was generated from. A mismatch means the specs
describe a program that is no longer the one in the tree — reported as STALE, with the
instruction to re-generate rather than to re-record.

Re-recording without re-generating is the failure mode to avoid: it makes the check agree
with whatever is there, which is a rubber stamp rather than a gate. `--record` therefore
prints what it is overwriting.

## Silence is not success

The check above needs a corpus hash it can *recompute from the tree*. It used to accept
three sources: the tracked `ast-<M>.json`, an `ast_hint` path, and — when both were absent
— `artifact-manifest.json`'s own `ast_sha256` field. That third source made the gate
vacuous. `corpus_ast_sha256` is also a manifest field, so on a fresh clone of the four
untracked corpora the gate compared the manifest against itself, agreed with itself, and
exited 0 without saying anything about the 74 tracked `SpecsGen/V8Base` spec files it was
supposed to be guarding. It was dark in CI in exactly the sense of §44.

The fallback is gone. A corpus hash now comes only from bytes on disk. When a spec module
is **tracked in git** and its corpus cannot be hashed from the tree, that is reported as
UNVERIFIABLE and exits 3 — the same verdict and the same exit code `check_render.py` uses
for the same situation. An untracked spec module with an absent corpus is a local build
product that legitimately does not exist in a fresh clone; it is reported as SKIPPED and
does not fail. Tracked theorems pinned to a corpus nobody can see is a different thing,
and it now has its own name.

Usage:  scripts/check_specs_fresh.py [--record] [--corpus Module ...]
Exit:   0 all specs current; 1 at least one stale; 2 nothing checkable;
        3 all checkable specs current, but a tracked spec module has no verifiable corpus.
