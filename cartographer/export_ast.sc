// Joern query: export each method's AST as a language-neutral JSON tree.
//
// This is Layer 3 (Transpiler), and it is deterministic — no LLM anywhere on this path.
//
// The reason one exporter suffices for many languages is that Joern has already done the
// normalization: C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Kotlin and binaries all land in the
// same CPG node vocabulary (CALL / IDENTIFIER / LITERAL / CONTROL_STRUCTURE / RETURN /
// BLOCK / FIELD_IDENTIFIER / METHOD_REF / TYPE_REF), with operators as `<operator>.*`
// calls. We map that vocabulary onto `Autoform.Core`, and anything we do not recognise
// becomes a *hole tagged with the node label that produced it*. Nothing is silently
// dropped, and nothing is guessed: where a construct cannot be translated faithfully the
// hole label says precisely which shape defeated us.
//
// Beyond the per-node mapping, the exporter answers three whole-program questions that
// the node vocabulary alone cannot: which names are module-level (exported as one
// `setGlobal` initializer per file), which function values capture an enclosing scope
// (`closure` rather than `fnref`), and — because the CPG is multi-language — which
// operators change meaning under the source dialect (a C `char*` is an address, so `+`
// and `<` are not the string operations they look like).

  // ---- module objects ---------------------------------------------------------
  //
  // ## What a module is, in Core
  //
  // `import functools` used to be a hole because Core has no module value, and pointing
  // the name at `fnref "functools"` would claim `functools.reduce` is an attribute of a
  // *function*. But a module does not need a new `Val` constructor: it is an **object**.
  // `Obj` has a class and a field table, `Expr.field` on a `Val.ref` already reads a
  // field from the heap, and `Stmt.setField` already writes one — so a module is an
  // object whose fields are its top-level names, and `os.path.join` is an ordinary field
  // access with no new semantics at all.
  //
  // ## Where they come from
  //
  // One synthetic zero-argument initializer, `<module-objects>:<module>`, emitted **first**
  // in `moduleInits`. Its body allocates one object per Python module of this CPG and
  // binds it into the globals frame under a reserved key, then writes the members. All
  // allocations precede all field writes, so a package that contains a module which
  // imports the package back (`ansible` / `ansible.errors`) is fine, and nesting is
  // unbounded: `a.b.c.d` is three field reads.
  //
  // ## What a module object contains, and what it deliberately does not
  //
  // Members are the module's top-level **functions**, **classes** and **submodules** —
  // exactly the names whose value is fixed by the CPG and does not depend on when the
  // module body ran. Module-level *data* (`__version__ = "7.1.7"`) is **not** a member,
  // and that is not an oversight: Core has a single globals frame shared by every module,
  // so a module-level constant is not module-scoped in the first place, and copying its
  // value into the module object at init time would capture it *before* the module body
  // that computes it has run. Binding `mod.__version__` to `unit` is precisely the silent
  // wrong answer this project keeps finding.
  //
  // So a miss has to be loud. `Semantics.evalExpr`'s `.field` case answers `unit` for a
  // field an object does not have — a documented hazard — and for a module object it
  // instead answers the hole `module-attr:<name>`. That is why the class name carries the
  // `<module>` prefix: it is the marker the interpreter tests, and no `class` statement
  // in any language can produce a class of that name.
  //
  // ## Cost
  //
  // One heap object per module (Ansible: 584) allocated once by `initGlobals`, plus one
  // `setField` per exported member. Linear in the program, paid once, and nothing in the
  // per-call path changes.

    * `structFieldSizesFromText` -> `segmentSizes` -> `memberSizeofBytes` ->
    * `aggregateSizeofBytes` is a real recursive chain, and none of it is
    * memoized against RE-ENTRANCY the way `structBodyTextCache`/
    * `structFieldOrderCache` cache their OWN, non-recursive results. A struct
    * cannot genuinely contain itself by value in valid C, so a real cycle here
    * is always a MISRESOLUTION (a duplicate-`TypeDecl` variant, or a text-parsed
    * member-type string that happens to read back to a type already being
    * sized higher up the same call stack) -- not reproduced against this
    * session's own `src/`-only bounded corpus, but reported from a separate
    * session's run of this notebook's own full, UNBOUNDED corpus (`ext/`/
    * `test/`/`tool/` included, a materially larger surface this session's local
    * sandbox has never parsed) as a real `StackOverflowError` crashing the whole
    * transpiler run. Falling back to `None` (the existing `op:sizeOf:object`
    * hole) the moment a cycle is detected is strictly safer than crashing --
    * exactly the "hole, not a guess, and never a crash" standard every other
    * fallback in this file already holds itself to -- and costs nothing for the
    * overwhelming non-cyclic case: the guard is released the moment each type's
    * OWN computation finishes, so an unrelated LATER request for the same type
    * (not nested inside a live cycle) still resolves normally.

    * single-hop "bare name" base requirement to an arbitrary CHAIN of pointer-typed
    * field accesses (`p->q->r`, `s.pField->r`, `pBt->pPage1->aData`, ...), so
    * `&EXPR->f`/`&EXPR->arr[i]` no longer needs EXPR itself to be a bare local or

    * is itself a compound field-access chain rather than a bare name (the four
    * existing single-hop mechanisms above correctly leave every one of these a
    * hole today, having no case for it at all).
    *
    * Two base cases, both already-proven "the value already IS its address"
    * identities elsewhere in this file:
    *   - a bare local/parameter whose OWN static type is a pointer to a known
    *     struct (`fieldReceiverAggregateType`'s pointer branch, the exact check
    *     `pointerStructFieldOperand` already makes for its own single-hop base).
    *   - a bare local that is itself a BOXED value-typed struct (`boxedStructs`) --
    *     its own environment binding is ALSO a `Val.ref`, for the identical reason
    *     `boxedStructFieldOperand` already trusts it, gated on registry membership
    *     specifically because (unlike a pointer parameter) a value-typed struct is
    *     ONLY actually bound to a `Val.ref` when this file chose to box it.
    *
    * One recursive case: `x` is a field access (`base.f`/`base->f`) whose OWN base
    * resolves recursively, AND `f`'s OWN declared type (`memberTypes`) is ALSO a
    * pointer to a known struct -- the chain continues one hop further, re-verified
    * against `memberTypes`/`structTypeDeclOf` exactly as a single-hop site already
    * is. This is the SAME soundness bar applied repeatedly, not a weaker one: a
    * hop through a VALUE-typed (non-pointer) nested member -- e.g. `pExpr->y.pTab`,
    * where `y` is an anonymous union member -- deliberately does NOT match here,
    * because that member's own read is not already a `Val.ref` the way a pointer
    * field's is; closing that shape would need its own nested-object boxing
    * (mirroring `boxedStructArrayMembers`' treatment of array-typed members) and is
    * left a hole, not guessed at.
    *
    * Returns the JSON expr reading that ref, together with the resolved struct
    * `TypeDecl`'s bare (duplicate-suffix-stripped) name, for a caller to look up
    * further members against via `memberTypes`. */

    * A parameter with zero dereferences at all is vacuously safe -- there is
    * nothing to guard. */
  // NOTE (pointer-indirection family, measured with a fixture): as written this
  // predicate is VACUOUS -- `fn.ast.isIdentifier.filter(_.name == paramName)` includes
  // the `p` operand of the dereference itself, and Joern's CFG evaluates a call's
  // operands before the call, so every `*p`/`p->f`/`p[i]` is dominated by its own
  // `p`; an unguarded `void f(int *p){ *p = 1; }` called with `0` passes. (Dominance
  // is also branch-insensitive: `if (p) {..} *p = 1;` would pass even without that.)
  // A branch-sensitive rewrite was tried and REJECTED on measurement: it demotes
  // callees whose null-safety rests on a correlated invariant rather than a local
  // test (`sqlite3MatchEName`'s `pbRowid` is only dereferenced when
  // `eEName==ENAME_ROWID`, which its callers only request with a non-null pointer;
  // likewise `sqlite3PagerOpenWal`, `tableAndColumnIndex`, `wherePartIdxExpr`).
  //
  // Admitting a `NullLit` call site does not NEED this check for soundness: a null
  // argument is a `Val.int 0`, and the only things a closed out-parameter is ever
  // dereferenced with -- `derefIref`/`setDerefIref` (and, before `boxedScalarAddr`,
  // `field`/`setField` on a box) -- all require a `Val.iref`/`Val.ref` and yield a
  // DYNAMIC hole (`derefIref:non-iref`, `setDerefIref:non-iref`) on anything else. So
  // a callee that really does dereference a null it was passed holes at run time on
  // that path; it can never produce a value. What this predicate controls is only how

    * parameters of the SAME function always receive arguments that are
    * PROVABLY the same underlying buffer, at every call site, across the whole
    * program". Motivated by `sqlite3DbSpanDup(db, zStart, zEnd)`'s own `zEnd -
    * zStart`, and its siblings across the corpus -- SQLite's own extremely
    * common "start/end of one token span, passed as a matched PARAMETER pair"
    * idiom (as opposed to `strCursorBase`'s existing WITHIN-one-function
    * derivation tracking, which has no way to relate two INDEPENDENT
    * parameters at all -- each is trivially its own base, by the same
    * reasoning a lone parameter always is, so two DIFFERENT parameter names
    * can never compare equal under it, regardless of what the CALLER actually
    * guarantees). Nothing inside `sqlite3DbSpanDup` itself can prove `zStart`
    * and `zEnd` share a buffer -- that fact lives entirely at its CALL SITES,
    * which is exactly the shape `closedOutParam`'s own family of checks exists
    * to verify.
    *
    * A pair (`fn`, `i`, `j`) is CLOSED when every call site of `fn`, across the
    * whole analyzed program, passes at positions `i`/`j` EITHER:
    *   - a syntactically self-evident same-POSITION shape (`sameBufferAtCallSite`:
    *     the identical pure expression twice -- the `zStart, zStart + n` spelling
    *     this also used to accept was unsound, see that def), or
    *   - a FORWARDED pair -- both arguments are bare references to two
    *     parameters of the CALLING function, and THAT pair is itself already
    *     known closed (the same `Fwd` bootstrapping `closedOutParamsTransitive`
    *     uses, generalized from one index to a pair of them).
    *
    * Candidates are every pair of char*-typed parameter positions of every
    * function with at least one in-scope call site -- NOT filtered down to
    * "the function's own body compares them" first, unlike a first-pass
    * version of this idea would suggest: a PURE FORWARDER (`sqlite3AddDefaultValue`,
    * `sqlite3ExprListSetSpan`, `triggerSpanDup`, ... -- confirmed live, all of
    * `sqlite3DbSpanDup`'s own callers on the local corpus are pure forwarders,
    * never comparing `zStart`/`zEnd` themselves at all) never appears as a
    * body-usage candidate, but MUST still participate as a `Fwd` link in the
    * chain, or the whole mechanism could never reach past one hop. A random
    * UNRELATED pair of char* parameters (`sqlite3_snprintf`'s own `zBuf`/
    * `zFormat`, say) simply never satisfies `Ok` or a closed `Fwd` at any real
    * call site and stays permanently open -- costing nothing beyond the
    * candidate enumeration itself.
    *
    * Consumed at `strCursorBase`'s own per-method computation (`emit`, below):
    * for the CURRENT method only, any closed pair among ITS OWN parameters has
    * both names unified onto one shared base, exactly as if one had been
    * derived from the other within a single function body.
    *
    * Diagnosed, NOT yet measured on the real corpus at the time this was
    * written -- the local bounded corpus (`src/` only) has exactly ONE
    * candidate function matching this idiom at all (`sqlite3DbSpanDup`), and
    * every one of its own callers, transitively, bottoms out in the
    * Lemon-generated parser (`parse.c`), outside this corpus's own parsed
    * scope -- so this mechanism cannot show ANY local movement regardless of
    * whether it is correct, and needs a real Colab run (where `ext/`/`test/`/
    * `tool/` trees may carry more, and different, instances of the idiom) to
    * learn its true yield. Shipped anyway, on the strength of the reasoning
    * above and zero local regressions, per this session's own explicit
    * instruction to try it and measure for real rather than estimate further
    * from an already-known-incomplete local sample. */

    * method-table field (`sqlite3_module.xOpen`, ...), never by its own
    * name. `closedOutParam` requires `allCalls.filter(_.methodFullName ==
    * fn.fullName)` to be non-empty -- for one of these it always is EMPTY
    * (every real call site is a `<operator>.pointerCall` reading the field,
    * not a direct call to this specific implementation), so `closedOutParam`
    * can never prove one closed no matter how safe its callers actually are.
    * Confirmed live: dozens of `assign:lhs:indirection`'s single-blocking-
    * label functions are exactly this shape (`statOpen`, `echoRowid`,
    * `unixFetch`, ...), each with zero direct call sites in the whole
    * program.
    *
    * The soundness argument is different from, but no weaker than,
    * `closedOutParam`'s own: every function assigned into the SAME struct
    * field shares that field's exact C function-pointer TYPE (the compiler
    * enforces this at the assignment), so a dispatch call THROUGH that field
    * is valid evidence for every implementation the field might hold at
    * runtime, not just whichever one this particular translation is
    * currently looking at. If EVERY dispatch call through `(owner, field)`,
    * anywhere in the program, passes a genuine `&local` at this parameter
    * position, `fn`'s own out-parameter is exactly as safe as
    * `closedOutParam`'s base case -- regardless of which implementation is
    * actually invoked at runtime.
    *
    * A function `vtableFieldsOf` cannot place in any known field (an
    * ordinary function, or one assigned only into a struct this cannot
    * text-parse) simply has no entries here and falls through to
    * `closedOutParam`'s existing, correctly negative, answer unchanged.
    *
    * Generalized the same way `closedOutParamsTransitive` generalizes
    * `closedOutParam`: a dispatch call site's argument is not always a fresh
    * `&local` -- confirmed live, `sqlite3OsFileSize`'s own body reads
    * `id->pMethods->xFileSize(id, pSize)`, forwarding its OWN `pSize`
    * parameter unchanged rather than taking a new address. That forward is
    * exactly as safe as a genuine `&local` PROVIDED `sqlite3OsFileSize`'s own
    * parameter is itself already known closed -- by the ordinary, direct-call
    * route (`closedOutParam`/`closedOutParamsTransitive`), since
    * `sqlite3OsFileSize` is called by name like any other function, not
    * itself a vtable target. `classify`/the bounded fixed point below mirror
    * `closedOutParamsTransitive` verbatim, with two differences: call sites
    * come from `vtableFieldsOf`'s dispatch fields instead of a direct-name
    * lookup, and a `Fwd` resolves against `closedOutParamsTransitive`/
    * `closedOutParam` (the direct-call world) OR this same set (chained
    * vtable forwarding), not `closedOutParamsTransitive` alone -- the two

    *
    * 1. A brace initializer, `{ ... }`: each child is a BLOCK wrapping one element.
    *    - all-positional  -> `Expr.listE`. A C array is an ordered sequence of values and
    *      that is what `Val.list` is; `a[i]` already maps to `Expr.index`, so the reads
    *      work. (Writes do not: `Stmt.setIndex` on a `Val.list` is Core's known
    *      immutable-container hole, unchanged by this.)
    *    - all-field-designated -> `Expr.dictE` keyed by the field names. A struct literal
    *      is a finite map from field names to values, C copies structs by value, and
    *      `Dialect.fieldsOnDicts` makes `s.f` read it back. This is what makes the
    *      kernel's `static struct x foo = { .a = 1 }` tables mean something.
    *    - anything mixed, or an index designator anywhere -> a hole naming which.
    *
    * 2. `009-reduce-remaining-holes-4` US3: a NESTED group -- `{ {1,2,3}, {4,5,6} }`
    *    (array-of-array/array-of-struct), including a macro-expanded struct-literal row
    *    (`FUNCTION(...)`-style tables in `func.c`, confirmed live: their macro expansion
    *    still surfaces as a real `<operator>.arrayInitializer` AST node, only the source
    *    `.code` stays the macro-call text). Unlike (1), Joern does NOT Block-wrap these
    *    children -- confirmed live across 30+ sample sites in `alter.c`/`analyze.c`/
    *    `complete.c`/`date.c`/`func.c`, both the plain-literal-table shape research.md
    *    §3 predicted AND a macro-driven struct-row shape whose own elements are full
    *    subexpressions (a bit-OR of flags, a `MethodRef` function value, a pointer-
    *    arithmetic offset trick) -- so this branch reuses `classifyInitElements` directly
    *    on the RAW children (no unwrap), which sends each element through the SAME
    *    `expr()` this file already uses everywhere else (`MethodRef` -> `fnValue`, a
    *    binop -> `Expr.binop`, ...). A further-nested child (array-of-array-of-array) is
    *    itself an `<operator>.arrayInitializer` `Call`, which `expr()` already dispatches
    *    back through `arrayInit` (`callExpr`'s existing `<operator>.arrayInitializer`
    *    case) -- so arbitrary depth recurses with no new mechanism, per FR-003. An
    *    element `expr()` cannot translate gets ITS OWN honest, specifically-named hole
    *    (`expr()`'s own catch-all, `hole("expr:" + other.label)`) rather than the whole
    *    group falling back to the declarator's blanket label (spec.md Acceptance
    *    Scenario 3) -- confirmed safe live: `expr()` has no un-holed default case, so an
    *    unrecognized element can only ever produce a labeled hole, never a crash or a
    *    silent guess.
    *
    *    Requiring 2+ raw children before taking this branch is deliberate, not
    *    incidental: a SINGLE non-Block child is the one shape genuinely ambiguous
    *    between this nested case (a one-element brace group, `{0}`) and construct 3
    *    below (a bare declarator, whose lone child is the size) -- Joern gives both the
    *    identical AST shape, and this project does not guess between them. That
    *    ambiguity can only arise at the outermost, un-nested position: once already
    *    inside a confirmed multi-element nested group (i.e. already past this check),
    *    a lone-child SUB-node can only be a one-element group, never a declarator's
    *    size, so recursion through `expr()`/`arrayInit` resolves it correctly without
    *    re-checking.
    *
    * 3. An array **declarator**: `u8 buf[NH_KEY_WORDS]` arrives as an arrayInitializer
    *    whose single child is the *size*, in statement position. It is a declaration, not
    *    a value, and modelling it needs the size model this project does not have — so it
    *    keeps a hole, but under `op:arrayDecl:size`, which says what it actually is
    *    rather than filing it with the initializers it has nothing to do with. */

    // C++20 fixed the one thing that used to make this implementation-defined: conversion
    // to a narrower integer type is two's-complement truncation, which is exactly
    // `IntType.wrap`. So the cast becomes a unary operator `cast:u8` (see `applyUnop`),
    // and `static_cast<uint8_t>(300)` is `44` in Core as it is under `cc`.
    //
    // A **pointer** cast is a different thing wearing the same syntax and is not
    // collapsed into it: reinterpreting an address has no meaning in a language with no
    // addresses. `char` is excluded too — its signedness is implementation-defined — and
    // so is `double`, which is a rounding conversion rather than a truncation.
    //
    // Two refinements on top of that:
    //
    // * The target type is resolved **through typedefs** (`resolveIntType`). V8 spells
    //   almost every integer as a class-local `using` — `Address`, `Chunk`,
    //   `unsigned_type` — and reading only the surface name reported 128 casts as
    //   `opaque-type` when the CPG holds a declaration saying what they are. A chain that
    //   does not reach a fixed-width type still yields a hole; nothing gets a default.
    //
    // * A cast **to `void`** is a discarded-value expression. `(void)0` alone is 492 of
    //   the 939 casts in `src/base`, because it is what `DCHECK`, `USE` and friends expand
    //   to in a release build. `void` is an incomplete type: `(void)e` has *no value*, and
    //   no well-formed C++ program can read one from it. So the only thing to preserve is
    //   the evaluation of `e`, and the translation splits on whether there is anything to
    //   preserve:
    //
    //     - `e` **pure** (a literal, a name, a field or index read of one): nothing
    //       happens when it is evaluated, so the whole expression is `unit` — the one
    //       value Core has that stands for "no value". Nothing is dropped and nothing is
    //       invented. This is the `(void)0` case, and it matters that it is not `0`:
    //       Joern's macro lowering hands `(void)0` back in *argument* position (`DCHECK`'s
    //       expansion becomes a call with the discarded expression as its argument), and
    //       there `0` would be a number the source never produced.
    //     - `e` **impure** (a call, an assignment, an increment): the effects are the
    //       entire content of the statement and must survive, so the operand is emitted
    //       and the cast disappears. The value it yields is one C++ forbids anyone from
    //       reading, so nothing observes the difference — and the subexpressions inside it
    //       become visible to the ledger, which is why `op:and` and `cstr:pointer-arith`
    //       *rise* slightly here: those were previously hidden underneath a cast hole.

    * does not name, and the listed ones get their listed values. So the initializer

    *     Block-wraps a designated element, which is refused), at most `N` values,

    *     `setDerefIref (irefIndex a k)` a plain `a[k] = v` statement already
    *     emits), then `a[k] = 0` for every remaining `k` -- unrolled when short,
    *     else a counted loop over a fresh `a$zi` counter (the `$` suffix keeps it
    *     out of C's identifier space, `strCursorParams`' own `$off` convention).
    *   - ARRAY of `char`-like elements initialized by a STRING LITERAL: its bytes
    *     (ASCII only; no backslash, since `expr`'s `Literal` case does not decode
    *     escapes), then the terminating `0` and the zero fill -- exactly the byte
    *     array C builds (6.7.9p14). A literal longer than `N` is refused.
    *   - STRUCT, positional brace list, EVERY member a scalar integer: member
    *     `k` (declaration order) gets `vk`, the rest `0`, via `setField` -- the
    *     same statement `s.f = v` already emits for a boxed struct.
    *
    * Each listed value must provably survive the implicit conversion to the element
    * type unchanged, because `setDerefIref`/`setField` store it unconverted: an
    * integer (or character) literal within the element type's range, or an
    * expression whose own static type resolves to the SAME integer type. A bare
    * `char` element (signedness implementation-defined) accepts only `0..127`.

    * boxed STRUCT) any right-hand side that is not an initializer at all -- a
    * whole-struct copy `s = t`/`s = *p`, which `skip` ALSO silently dropped (the

    * missing the property `switch` needs -- absorbing a `break` without also absorbing
    * a `continue`, unlike `Stmt.loop`/`Stmt.forIn`).
    *

    * *reference* is free in memory, but JSON has no notion of a shared reference: a node
    * reachable from `k` different paths in the tree is serialized `k` times. For `n`
    * segments that is O(n^2) total output size -- confirmed, not assumed, via an
    * out-of-memory crash on SQLite's own `sqlite3VdbeExec` (`src/vdbe.c`, ~190-case

    * proving it was this quadratic blowup and not merely "a large function needs more
    * memory" (`006-reduce-remaining-holes`'s own `maxHeartbeats` precedent). The flat
    * encoding below has each segment's body appear exactly ONCE in the output, full stop.
    *
    * The encoding: `fell` starts false and is set true the first time either (a) the
    * controlling value matches one of THIS segment's case values, or (b) this is the
    * `default` segment and `matched` (computed ONCE, up front, as the OR of every real
    * case's values, regardless of `default`'s own lexical position) is false. Once
    * `fell` is true, every subsequent segment's body runs unconditionally -- exactly
    * `switch`'s real fallthrough semantics -- until a `break` (`Stmt.brk`) is hit, which
    * propagates out of the flat `Stmt.seq` chain via its ordinary short-circuit-on-
    * non-normal-result behavior (unchanged, existing `execStmt` semantics) straight to
    * the wrapping `breakBlock`, ending the whole dispatch there.
    *
    * The controlling expression is evaluated at most ONCE: `pureExpr` decides whether
    * it is safe to duplicate across every comparison, or must be hoisted into a fresh
    * temp first (the same discipline `006-reduce-remaining-holes` Story 3 established
    * for assignment-as-value's own double-evaluation risk).
    *
    * Empirically confirmed against this Joern version (not assumed): a `switch`'s body
    * `Block` interleaves, per label, a `JumpTarget` (`parserTypeName` `CASTCaseStatement`
    * for `case`, `CASTDefaultStatement` for `default`) immediately followed -- for
    * `case` only -- by a `Literal` sibling holding the label's value; ordinary

  /** A method body, translating the kernel's `goto out;` idiom when — and only when — it

    *
    *     A;  if (e) goto out;  B;  out:  C;  return r;
    *
    * is exactly
    *
    *     while (true) { A; if (e) break; B; break }   C;  return r;
    *
    * The `while (true) { ...; break }` runs its body once; a jump inside it is a `break`,
    * which leaves for `C`. Nothing is invented: `Stmt.loop` plus `Stmt.brk` already mean
    * "a block you can jump out of", and that is all this jump is. `return` passes
    * straight through a loop, so the early-return paths are unaffected.
    *
    * **Every one of these conditions is load-bearing**, and each one, dropped, turns the
    * translation from correct into silently wrong rather than into a hole:
    *
    *  - Exactly **one** label in the function, and every jump targets it. Two labels need
    *    two nested wrappers and a choice about which; jumps between them can be
    *    irreducible, and an irreducible flow graph is not structured control flow at all.
    *  - The label is a **direct child of the function body**, so "the rest of the
    *    function" is a suffix of one statement list rather than a jump into the middle of
    *    a nested block.
    *  - Every jump is **before** the label in that list — a *forward* jump. A backward one
    *    is a loop, and this encoding would turn it into a straight line.
    *  - No jump is inside a `for`/`while`/`do`/`switch`. This is the one that would bite:
    *    `break` inside a loop leaves *that* loop, so the jump would land in the wrong
    *    place and the program would still type-check. (`switch` is a hole today, so its
    *    body is not translated at all — but the check does not rely on that.)
    *
    * Measured on `crypto/`: 234 functions contain a jump of this kind, 161 have a single
    * label, 105 of those are forward jumps to a tail label, and 82 also clear the loop
    * condition. The other 152 kept `control:GOTO` until `009-reduce-remaining-holes-4`'s
    * own multi-label generalization below -- see its doc comment for how a MULTIPLE-
    * cascading-label function (SQLite's own dominant real shape: `goto cleanup;` to a
    * shared error-handling tail, sometimes staged through more than one label) is
    * handled too, without needing the "two nested wrappers" this comment used to name
    * as the reason multiple labels stayed unsupported. */

    /** `009-reduce-remaining-holes-4`: the general case above's own named limit --
      * "two labels need two nested wrappers and a choice about which" -- doesn't
      * actually need wrappers at all. A bare `Stmt.brk` (what `Stmt.loop`/
      * `Stmt.breakBlock` catch) is exactly as single-level as C's own `break`, so
      * nesting more of either can never let one `break` cross more than its own
      * innermost scope -- that is precisely why C itself has no multi-level break
      * and reaches for `goto` instead. Trying to encode N labels as N nested
      * loop-wrappers therefore cannot work, for the same reason the source needed
      * `goto` rather than `break` in the first place; this file is not going to
      * out-clever that.
      *
      * The actual fix is to stop trying to make `goto` INTO a break, and translate
      * it as what it computationally IS instead: "run the rest of the function
      * starting from here." For a FORWARD jump to a label that is a direct child of
      * the function body, "the rest of the function starting from there" is simply
      * the tail of one already-known statement list (`ks.drop(labelIndex + 1)`) --
      * so a copy of it, re-translated in place at the `goto` site, is exactly as
      * faithful a translation as the label itself falling through to it normally.
      * This is a batch, one-time AST transform (`render_lean.py` runs once, ahead
      * of any proof or execution), so duplicating that tail costs generated-Lean
      * size, never correctness -- unlike inlining at RUNTIME, there is no risk of
      * unbounded blowup from a cycle, because the SAME conditions the single-label
      * case already requires (forward-only, top-level, never inside a loop) rule
      * cycles out structurally: a jump can only ever reach a label AFTER its own
      * position, so recursively re-translating a copied tail that itself contains
      * a `goto` to a STILL-LATER label terminates by strict induction on label
      * position, the same way the fixed-point loops elsewhere in this file
      * terminate by their own bound.
      *
      * Confirmed live against this exact idiom: SQLite's `sqlite3Insert` has two
      * labels, `insert_end` and `insert_cleanup`, `insert_cleanup` strictly after
      * `insert_end` -- every `goto insert_cleanup` needs to skip `insert_end`'s own
      * tail code, while falling through normally runs BOTH in sequence, exactly
      * what a plain tail-copy from each label's own position reproduces without
      * needing to know anything about how many labels came before it. */
    // `009-reduce-remaining-holes-4`: a REAL soundness gap in the multi-label
    // mechanism above, found by actually running its own generated Lean rather
    // than by inspecting the export logic in isolation. `gotoTailStmts(label) =
    // ks.drop(labelIndex + 1)` is spliced in PLACE OF the `goto` node itself --
    // one statement, wherever it sits (often nested inside an `if`'s own
    // then-branch). Once that spliced copy finishes running, if it does so by
    // reaching its OWN end normally (`Ctl.normal`, not an early `.ret`/`.exn`),
    // `execStmt`'s `.seq` case (Semantics.lean) does exactly what it always
    // does after a NORMAL result: keeps going with whatever comes NEXT in the
    // ENCLOSING sequence the `if` itself sits inside -- which is the ORIGINAL,
    // never-removed code that the real `goto` was supposed to skip entirely.
    // Confirmed live: a fixture (`GotoCheck.c`) with two labels and NO trailing
    // `return` (a `void` function correctly falling off the end) produced
    // generated Lean whose `if (e1 != 0) { <mid's tail, spliced> } else { skip
    // }` is followed, UNCONDITIONALLY, by the ORIGINAL untouched tail -- so
    // `record(100)` (which a real `goto mid` must skip) ran on EVERY call,
    // `e1` true or false, and the mid/end tail code ran TWICE whenever `e1` was
    // true. This was silently wrong, not a hole, on every CURRENTLY-COUNTED

    // itself force an exit -- exactly the failure Constitution Principle III
    // forbids, and this file's own `singleLabelOk` doc comment is careful never
    // to introduce (its `while(true){...; brk}` wrapper cannot have this
    // problem: `Stmt.brk` is never `.normal`, so the loop's own unconditional
    // trailing `brk` always fires before anything past the loop can run).
    //
    // Every jump's own target-tail is a SUFFIX of the SAME `ks`, so they all
    // share one final element -- `ks.last` -- and it suffices to require THAT
    // one statement to be an unconditional `return`: if it is, every spliced
    // copy's own execution necessarily bottoms out in that same `.ret`
    // (Ctl.ret, never `.normal`), so `.seq`'s "keep going" branch can never
    // fire past it, at ANY nesting depth the splice happens to sit at.
    // Deliberately narrow (a bare `Return` node, not e.g. an `if`/`else` where
    // both branches return) -- broader recognition is a possible future
    // extension, not a requirement for soundness, and this file's own
    // precedent throughout is to accept a narrower, provably-safe subset over
    // a broader, harder-to-verify one.
    // `010-reach-90pct-hole-free` US6: the check just above this comment used
    // to be `val tailAlwaysExits = ks.lastOption.exists(_.isInstanceOf[Return])`
    // -- a single, function-wide check that `ks.last` itself is a bare
    // `Return`. `resolvedTailStmts` (above) generalizes this per-label: any
    // `ks.last` that IS a bare `Return` is found by its forward scan too (the
    // exact same check, just reached by walking forward instead of indexing
    // straight to the end), so nothing that used to qualify stops qualifying.
    // `009-reduce-remaining-holes-4`, loop-nesting generalization: NO `!insideLoop(g)`
    // check here, unlike `singleLabelOk` above -- and deliberately so, not an
    // oversight. `insideLoop` was excluded historically because `singleLabelOk`'s
    // OWN mechanism (`Stmt.brk` inside a synthetic `while(true){...}` wrapper) is
    // UNSOUND for a nested goto: `Stmt.brk` only exits the INNERMOST loop it is
    // lexically inside, so a `goto` nested K loops deep would only escape ONE of
    // them, landing in the wrong place. `multiLabelOk`'s OWN mechanism is
    // completely different -- it never uses `brk` at all, it SPLICES a copy of
    // the target label's own tail in place of the `goto` node, wherever that node
    // sits -- and `tailAlwaysExits` (just above) already guarantees that spliced
    // copy's execution bottoms out in an unconditional `Stmt.ret`. Checked
    // directly against `Semantics.lean`'s own `execStmt`: `.loop`'s `.brk` case is
    // the ONLY Ctl variant it catches (`.ret`/`.exn`/`.hole`/`.outOfFuel` all fall
    // through its `| (h₂, r) => (h₂, r)` catch-all, propagating unchanged), and
    // `.breakBlock` (SWITCH's own lowering) is identical -- it catches ONLY
    // `.brk`, explicitly not even `.cont`. So a `.ret` reached anywhere inside a
    // spliced copy propagates cleanly through ANY number of enclosing
    // `.loop`/`.forIn`/`.breakBlock` wrappers, all the way to the function's own
    // top level, regardless of how many loops or switches the `goto` was nested
    // inside. Measured live (diagnostic query, this push): 411 of 829 gotos on
    // the bounded local corpus are inside a loop or switch -- the dominant
    // reason a function fails BOTH mechanisms today -- so this one check removal
    // is expected to be the single highest-leverage step available in the
    // char*-unrelated hole families.
    // `010-reach-90pct-hole-free` US6: the per-jump `gi < labelIndex`
    // forward-only requirement this check used to carry is DROPPED here, not
    // merely relaxed -- once EVERY declared label's own `resolvedTailStmts` is

    // this push: SQLite's OWN allocator functions (`sqlite3DbMallocZero`,

    // constructors follow exactly this idiom). Treating the second shape as a
    // byte-array (`Val.iref _ (.idx 0)`) is a genuine semantic mismatch with its

    // it is immediately handed off whole (`pNew->pSrc = pSrc;`) for some OTHER
    // function to eventually field-access. The within-this-function field-access
    // guard cannot see that far, and treating `pSrc` as a byte array anyway would
    // not just mis-count a hole here -- it would hand a LATER field read on
    // `pNew->pSrc` a `Val.iref` backed by an integer-indexed `Obj`, which
    // `Sel.fld` lookups silently miss to `.unit`, a genuine SILENT-WRONG-ANSWER
    // risk, not merely an honest hole, if that later access ever happened to

    // regression. The original version of the assignment-count filter used
    // `.find` (the FIRST bare assignment to `l.name`, matched against its own

    // zPathname = malloc(...); zPathname[0] = 0; }`, confirmed live in
    // `sqlite3PagerOpen`) could qualify off whichever assignment the
    // traversal happened to see first.

    // (`data = pPage->aData;`) is ALSO written through by index elsewhere

    // `assignTo`'s own index-assignment dispatch does not route an
    // index-write through `strCursorParams`'s read-only machinery at all
    // (a `Val.str` write was never reachable through that path to begin
    // with), so the extra guard was excluding real, already-safe cases for
    // a risk that does not exist for THIS shape. `bareAssignsToName.size
    // == 1` alone is what the counterexample above actually needed.

    // `010-reach-90pct-hole-free`: the SINGLE round this used to run (adding

    * const char *sqlite3_column_database_name(sqlite3_stmt*,int);` in `sqlite3.h`,
    * no `{...}` body anywhere in source -- confirmed live to be the dominant real
    * shape (117 of 159 solo-`stmt:empty-ast-children`-blocked functions sampled
    * this session) behind a label that looked like a translation gap but is
    * actually a MEASUREMENT one: Joern still emits a `Method` node for the bare
    * declaration (`isExternal=false`, since it is a local, not a library, symbol),
    * with a synthetic zero-child `Block` whose leftover `.code` text (an attribute
    * macro, the trailing declarator) is non-empty -- exactly `stmt:empty-ast-
    * children`'s own trigger condition, reused verbatim here, but checked at the
    * METHOD's own top-level body, not a nested block partway through real logic
    * (that second, genuinely-different shape -- 13 of the 159 sampled -- is a real
    * function with an actual dark-`#ifdef` block inside it, and stays exactly the
    * hole it already is, unaffected by this filter). There is no real logic here
    * to be hole-free OR holed about -- counting it inflated both the denominator
    * and the hole-free numerator, mirroring this file's own adjacent precedent
    * for `<metaClassCallHandler>` et al. immediately above: excluding it removes
    * padding, not coverage. Deliberately NOT applied to a genuinely empty `{}`
    * body (`stripBlockCode` empty there) -- that shape already translates
    * correctly today (an empty statement sequence) and is real, if trivial, code,
    * not measurement padding. */

  // dependency (method A's parameter eligibility can depend on method B's own
  // local eligibility, which can depend on method C's parameter eligibility,
  // ...), not something one pass over the methods in any fixed order can
  // resolve on its own. Rather than restructuring `emit`'s own per-method
  // computation into two separate phases (setup vs. translation) so a
  // standalone whole-program analysis could run BEFORE any real translation
  // -- a materially larger and riskier change, since `boxedArrays`/
  // `boxedLocals`/`localTypes`/... are themselves a long CASCADE of per-method
  // state each `emit` call builds up progressively -- this instead runs the
  // ENTIRE `emit` pass over every method multiple times, throwing away the
  // JSON output of every pass but the last. `irefNamesByMethod` is the one
  // `var` in this file that is NEVER reset between calls (see its own doc
  // comment), so each priming pass's `ptrIrefNames` results become visible to
  // every OTHER method's `wideClosedIrefParam` check on the NEXT pass --
  // `irefNamesByMethod` only ever GROWS across passes (a wider parameter seed
  // can only ADD tracked names within a method, per `classifyIrefAssignRhs`'s
  // own monotonicity -- its disqualification set depends solely on that
  // method's OWN assignment shapes, never on the seed), so repeated passes
  // converge toward the same fixed point a genuine whole-program analysis
  // would compute directly. Bounded at 2 priming passes (3 total, including
  // the real one) -- matches this file's own established "bounded rather than
  // recursive/unbounded" convention (`closedOutParamsTransitive`'s own 8-round
  // bound, `ptrIrefNames`'s own 4-round bound), sized for the call-chain
  // depths actually observed in this idiom (live-sampled: overwhelmingly a
  // single hop -- a leaf helper's own parameter, called by several higher-level
  // functions passing their own already-simple local variable) rather than an
  // unbounded fixed point this file has no established precedent for at
  // whole-program scale. Every priming pass's own diagnostic side effects
  // (`syncElided`/`useElided`'s own counters, `elseFlagSeq`'s own synthesized
  // flag names) are harmless to repeat: the former are cosmetic console counts
  // only, and the latter needs only PER-RUN uniqueness, which a monotonically
  // increasing counter still guarantees regardless of its starting value.

  // `irefNamesByMethod` the PREVIOUS pass finished with, the same "one round
