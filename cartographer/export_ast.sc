// Joern query: export each method's AST as a language-neutral JSON tree.
//
// This is Layer 3 (Transpiler), and it is deterministic — no LLM anywhere on this path.
//
// The reason one exporter suffices for many languages is that Joern has already done the
// normalization: C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, Kotlin and binaries all land in the
// same CPG node vocabulary (CALL / IDENTIFIER / LITERAL / CONTROL_STRUCTURE / RETURN /
// BLOCK / FIELD_IDENTIFIER / METHOD_REF / TYPE_REF), with operators as `<operator>.*`
// calls. We map that vocabulary onto `Autoform.Core`, and anything we do not recognise
// becomes a *hole tagged with the node label that produced it*. Nothing is silently
// dropped, and nothing is guessed: where a construct cannot be translated faithfully the
// hole label says precisely which shape defeated us.
//
// Beyond the per-node mapping, the exporter answers three whole-program questions that
// the node vocabulary alone cannot: which names are module-level (exported as one
// `setGlobal` initializer per file), which function values capture an enclosing scope
// (`closure` rather than `fnref`), and — because the CPG is multi-language — which
// operators change meaning under the source dialect (a C `char*` is an address, so `+`
// and `<` are not the string operations they look like).

  // ---- module objects ---------------------------------------------------------
  //
  // ## What a module is, in Core
  //
  // `import functools` used to be a hole because Core has no module value, and pointing
  // the name at `fnref "functools"` would claim `functools.reduce` is an attribute of a
  // *function*. But a module does not need a new `Val` constructor: it is an **object**.
  // `Obj` has a class and a field table, `Expr.field` on a `Val.ref` already reads a
  // field from the heap, and `Stmt.setField` already writes one — so a module is an
  // object whose fields are its top-level names, and `os.path.join` is an ordinary field
  // access with no new semantics at all.
  //
  // ## Where they come from
  //
  // One synthetic zero-argument initializer, `<module-objects>:<module>`, emitted **first**
  // in `moduleInits`. Its body allocates one object per Python module of this CPG and
  // binds it into the globals frame under a reserved key, then writes the members. All
  // allocations precede all field writes, so a package that contains a module which
  // imports the package back (`ansible` / `ansible.errors`) is fine, and nesting is
  // unbounded: `a.b.c.d` is three field reads.
  //
  // ## What a module object contains, and what it deliberately does not
  //
  // Members are the module's top-level **functions**, **classes** and **submodules** —
  // exactly the names whose value is fixed by the CPG and does not depend on when the
  // module body ran. Module-level *data* (`__version__ = "7.1.7"`) is **not** a member,
  // and that is not an oversight: Core has a single globals frame shared by every module,
  // so a module-level constant is not module-scoped in the first place, and copying its
  // value into the module object at init time would capture it *before* the module body
  // that computes it has run. Binding `mod.__version__` to `unit` is precisely the silent
  // wrong answer this project keeps finding.
  //
  // So a miss has to be loud. `Semantics.evalExpr`'s `.field` case answers `unit` for a
  // field an object does not have — a documented hazard — and for a module object it
  // instead answers the hole `module-attr:<name>`. That is why the class name carries the
  // `<module>` prefix: it is the marker the interpreter tests, and no `class` statement
  // in any language can produce a class of that name.
  //
  // ## Cost
  //
  // One heap object per module (Ansible: 584) allocated once by `initGlobals`, plus one
  // `setField` per exported member. Linear in the program, paid once, and nothing in the
  // per-call path changes.

    // * The target type is resolved **through typedefs** (`resolveIntType`). V8 spells
    //   almost every integer as a class-local `using` — `Address`, `Chunk`,
    //   `unsigned_type` — and reading only the surface name reported 128 casts as
    //   `opaque-type` when the CPG holds a declaration saying what they are. A chain that
    //   does not reach a fixed-width type still yields a hole; nothing gets a default.
    //
    // * A cast **to `void`** is a discarded-value expression. `(void)0` alone is 492 of
    //   the 939 casts in `src/base`, because it is what `DCHECK`, `USE` and friends expand
    //   to in a release build. `void` is an incomplete type: `(void)e` has *no value*, and

    //   the evaluation of `e`, and the translation splits on whether there is anything to

    //       invented. This is the `(void)0` case, and it matters that it is not `0`:
    //       Joern's macro lowering hands `(void)0` back in *argument* position (`DCHECK`'s
    //       expansion becomes a call with the discarded expression as its argument), and
    //       there `0` would be a number the source never produced.
    //     - `e` **impure** (a call, an assignment, an increment): the effects are the
    //       entire content of the statement and must survive, so the operand is emitted
    //       and the cast disappears. The value it yields is one C++ forbids anyone from

    * translation from correct into silently wrong rather than into a hole:
    *
    *  - Exactly **one** label in the function, and every jump targets it. Two labels need
    *    two nested wrappers and a choice about which; jumps between them can be
    *    irreducible, and an irreducible flow graph is not structured control flow at all.
    *  - The label is a **direct child of the function body**, so "the rest of the
    *    function" is a suffix of one statement list rather than a jump into the middle of
    *    a nested block.
    *  - Every jump is **before** the label in that list — a *forward* jump. A backward one
    *    is a loop, and this encoding would turn it into a straight line.
    *  - No jump is inside a `for`/`while`/`do`/`switch`. This is the one that would bite:
    *    `break` inside a loop leaves *that* loop, so the jump would land in the wrong
    *    place and the program would still type-check. (`switch` is a hole today, so its
    *    body is not translated at all — but the check does not rely on that.)
    *
    * Measured on `crypto/`: 234 functions contain a jump of this kind, 161 have a single
    * label, 105 of those are forward jumps to a tail label, and 82 also clear the loop
    * condition. The other 152 keep `control:GOTO`, which is the honest answer for them. */
